# Working on SJK

SJK is a native Rust engine, client and dedicated server for Jedi Academy
multiplayer. Read [docs/status.md](docs/status.md),
[docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and the relevant page in the
[project wiki](docs/README.md) before changing code.

## Compatibility and architecture

- Preserve OpenJK multiplayer `codemp` movement, weapon/saber timing and
  animation behavior. Gameplay changes need reference evidence, not visual guesses.
  Cover integer command steps of 8/7/4/3 ms (125/142/250/333 FPS).
- Protocol 26 is fixed. Encode/decode changes in `sjk-protocol` or `sjk-network`
  need OpenJK-emitted or captured byte fixtures. Never infer wire correctness
  from a successful connection alone. Use `codemp`, not the single-player `code` tree.
- Keep legacy formats, identifiers and limits in compatibility adapters.
  Engine world ownership and presentation must remain independent of the wire.
- Community PK3 maps and models are compatibility inputs, just like retail assets.
  Modern rendering and UI must preserve gameplay and content semantics.
- Write small, named modules with rustdoc for public APIs. Keep new viewer work
  out of `crates/sjk-viewer/src/main.rs`; use focused modules instead.
- Every player-facing addition (screen, page, pop-up, setting, browser) ships
  with its SJK UI version in the same change; a classic+-only addition is not
  accepted, while an SJK UI-only one is (it then shows its SJK look in every menu
  style). See [the rule in sjk-ui.md](docs/sjk-ui.md#sjk-ui).
- Avoid new allocation, locking and quadratic work in per-frame paths. Measure
  performance-sensitive changes in release builds; 500+ FPS is a target, not a
  blanket claim about current performance.

## Verification and scope

- Follow [development.md](docs/development.md). Before handing off a change, run
  `cargo fmt --all --check`, `cargo build --locked --workspace`,
  `cargo test --locked --workspace` and
  `cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets`. Explain any check that could
  not run.
- Passing Cargo tests currently does not establish gameplay parity: the repository
  has no bundled regression suite. Use focused external evidence for affected behavior.
  Small unit tests and fixtures that pin the changed behavior, such as the byte
  fixtures above, belong with the change; they never contain retail game data. New
  test infrastructure, harnesses or large reports need task authorization.
- Only exercise servers you control without human players. Do not automate chat
  messages. Use an unobtrusive name and stop only processes started for your check.
- Never commit retail game data, downloaded PK3s, credentials or personal paths.
  Put scratch evidence under `target/parity-reports/`, not `/tmp`, and remove it
  when finished. Keep a concise verification summary in the change description.
- Respect the requested scope and existing work. Do not discard unrelated changes,
  rewrite history or publish without authorization. A status page is context, not
  permission to start a new task.
- Follow the [branch, commit and pull request
  rules](docs/development.md#branches-commits-and-pull-requests): one topic per
  branch and pull request, never commit to `main`.

## Documentation is part of the change

- When behavior, architecture, configuration or build instructions change, update
  the relevant wiki page in the same change and commit. Add new pages to the index.
- Update `docs/status.md` when verification, a known limitation or agreed priorities
  change. Record the revision, environment, evidence and limits of new verification.
- Distinguish implemented, verified and planned. Code presence is not proof of
  correctness; a smoke check is not full compatibility or performance certification.
- Keep durable decisions and current facts in the wiki. Do not append chat transcripts,
  session diaries, speculative completion claims or duplicate task histories.
- Documentation-only changes belong with their subject. Unchanged behavior does not
  require a ceremonial wiki update. Review affected links when moving code or docs.
- `AGENTS.md` is the shared instruction source; `CLAUDE.md` points here. Keep
  operational facts in the wiki so assistant-specific files cannot drift apart.

Finish with a short report of what changed, how it was verified and what remains
unverified. Commit and push only within the user's authorized scope.
