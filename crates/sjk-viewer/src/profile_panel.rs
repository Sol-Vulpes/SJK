//! The Profile page: the player's SJK profile as others see it on the hub (picture,
//! name, verified flag, names worn, medals and bio), their own record from the
//! achievement counts, and the way to their achievements and collection
//! (`docs/identity.md`, "Profile", "Pictures", "Medals" and "Achievements"). The bio is written here, under
//! the hub's rules (`sjk_identity::bio`): what cannot be in a bio cannot be typed, and
//! what the hub sends back is shown only through those rules.
//!
//! The picture is changed here too: the player's picture on the left opens the picture
//! panel in the bio's place. A picture file chosen with Browse... (the system's file
//! dialog, opened on a worker thread), dropped on the window or named to the
//! `sjkavatar` command is read on a worker thread, checked, cropped and scaled
//! (`avatars::picture`) and shown as a preview; Use this picture sends it to the hub.
//!
//! In the SJK UI it is the Profile screen's SJK Profile tab ([`crate::profile_hub`],
//! [`Mode::Hub`]); its See the board and See the collection open the Collection screen
//! (`collection_panel`). In the classic menus the `profile` command opens it on its own,
//! the medals on the profile ([`Mode::Pages`]), and its buttons open the Collection page
//! on its own. Like the Identity page it lives in the console and is drawn in place of
//! it, always in the SJK UI's look ([`view`]). Tab moves between the picture, the bio
//! and their buttons; Enter saves the bio from the field (Shift+Enter starts a new
//! line); Escape goes back.
