//! The sender card a player's name shows when the pointer rests on it in a chat
//! (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "Muting a player"): in the game's chat while the composer is
//! open, on the main page's dock and on the SJK chat page. It shows what the SJK hub and
//! the server say of them, as the Players page's card does (their picture, or their
//! initial, as [`crate::profile_card::avatar`] draws it; their name and the verified
//! tick, whether the hub knows them, their key and hub name, their medals' medallions,
//! where they are on this server and how they were matched), and Mute or Unmute, which
//! hides their chat, draws them as Kyle with the default saber and silences them on this
//! PC only. For a player the hub vouches for, a sender it does not vouch for also gets
//! Ban 24 h beside it ([`crate::chat_ban`]). In the game's chat, where a click pins the
//! card, a player on the server also gets Whisper at the head of the buttons
//! ([`Tokens::whisper`], `chat/card.rs`).
//!
//! The card is built when the name under the pointer changes and drawn every frame
//! without allocating; each place that shows it keeps it up while the pointer moves
//! from the name onto the card (its [`Tokens::card`] target).
