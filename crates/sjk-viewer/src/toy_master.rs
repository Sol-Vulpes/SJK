//! The Toy Master's secrets (Sol's idea, 30/10/2026; `docs/toy-master.md`): toys SJK's
//! creator, the Toy Master, hides on maps through the hub, for players to find with
//! `+use`. This module knows no toy: the hub sends each one's model, sound and show with
//! the toys placed (`sjk_identity::toy_master`), so what is hidden stays a surprise.
//! It draws the toys standing on the loaded map file, counts the player's Use presses on
//! the one they face and sends them twice a second, and plays a toy's show when the hub
//! says the presses of every player there reached its number: the toy shrinks away,
//! pops back and spins to its sound. Other players' shows come through the hub's toy
//! event. The first press on a toy finds it: the hub unlocks its hidden achievement,
//! announced here. No game server knows of a toy: SJK clients alone draw it, and it has
//! no collision.
