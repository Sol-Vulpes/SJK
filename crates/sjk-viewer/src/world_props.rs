//! World surfaces the client moves on its own.

//! A prop is a static world face cut out of the world batches at load time
//! and drawn through the mover path instead, so it can be offset per frame
//! like an inline model. The first prop is the menu's gate on mp/ffa3: one
//! planar face split along its seam into two leaves that slide apart when
//! the client connects to a server. The map's own geometry is untouched — a
//! prop at rest draws exactly where the world batch drew it.
