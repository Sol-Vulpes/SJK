//! The Staff page: for a player the hub's operator made staff, the SJK team's tools
//! in the game (`docs/identity.md`, "Staff"): find a player (by name or key id, among
//! the SJK players on this server, those playing now anywhere or the SJK team; a search
//! that finds one player chooses them), then, on the chosen player's tabs, verify them
//! and moderate their picture and SJK chat (Overview), give or take back their medals
//! and saber shaders (Medals and shaders, the shaders found by name, number or tier),
//! their holocrons, kyber crystals, credits and kyber shards (Holocrons and credits),
//! clear their achievements, list their keys and unlink one or merge another player into
//! them (a player who reset their key), and ask them for their game's logs; three more
//! tabs read every player's crash reports, the SJK chat bans in force (with Lift) beside
//! how many players translate chat lines (since 11/11/2026), and the staff member's own
//! gifts of the day (with Undo). Since 08/11/2026 every staff member
//! gives medals, ranks, shaders, holocrons and crystals, a number a day and never to
//! themselves; taking back stays the creator's. Key ids never show on the
//! page (nor anywhere in the game): players go by name, a pasted key id shows as dots,
//! and linked keys are numbered. Every action is a
//! request signed by the player's own key (`sjk_identity::StaffRequest`,
//! `sjk_identity::StaffQuery`); the hub refuses it from any other key, and the page
//! only opens for a key whose profile says staff.
//!
//! Opened by the Profile page's Staff tools button or the `staff` command. Like the
//! Profile page it lives in the console and has the SJK UI's look ([`view`]). Tab
//! and Shift+Tab walk every control; Enter or Space works the one focused; the
//! search pill, the note, the shader filter and the merge field take typing; Up and Down
//! move through the players found; Escape goes back (or lets go of a merge being
//! confirmed or picked).
