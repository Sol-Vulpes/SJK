//! Quests (`toy_quests`; wonner67's idea in #ideas, 04/11/2026): now and then the SJK
//! hub gives one player taking part a quest with a minute to finish it. The first kind,
//! the social quest, asks them to hug (JA+ `amhug`) or kiss (`amkiss`) each of the
//! players it names; a finished quest wins a holocron (an Echo on JoF's servers, as one
//! earned by playing: within the day's cap), a few times a day.
//!
//! - **Opt-in:** the switch (`toy_quests`, the key bindings) is the consent to take part:
//!   only players with it on are given a quest, named in one, or told of them. It stays
//!   as last switched ([`crate::toy_saved::QUESTS_CVAR`]).
//! - **Told:** the switch travels in the player's look ([`TOY`] among its toys), which is
//!   what the hub reads when it gives a quest.
//! - **Proof:** the hub never sees an emote. This client, when its player is a target
//!   still to do, watches its own player state: the frame the game server puts it in the
//!   hugged or kissed half of the pair (`BOTH_HUGGEE1`, `BOTH_KISSEE`, set by the server,
//!   never predicted) with the quest's player standing next to it, it tells the hub who
//!   did it (`POST /v1/quests/done`). Nobody finishes a quest alone.
//!
//! Every number on the hub's side is provisional (Sol's to tune).
