//! The unlock pop-up: a small card that slides in at the top centre of the screen when
//! something comes to the player ([`Unlock`]), and plays the single-player game's
//! secret-area sound (`audio/ui_cues.rs`, off with `cg_achievementSound 0`):
//!
//! - an achievement unlocked (`achievements_frame.rs`), with the board's medallion
//!   (`achievements/medallion.rs`), "Achievement unlocked", its name, category and what
//!   it asked;
//! - a new medal or holocron that arrives during a match (`medal_popup.rs`,
//!   `holocron_popup.rs`), with the medallion's picture or the tier's icon (its gem
//!   without one), "New medal" or "New holocron", its name, what it is for or where it
//!   came from, and where to see it: the large pop-up still waits for the game menu, and
//!   takes the cards of what it shows away as it opens ([`UnlockToast::withdraw`]);
//! - a newer SJK release the update check found (`update.rs`), once a session, with
//!   SJK's emblem, "Update available", the version and where to install it, in the SJK
//!   UI's holo blue and without the sound; the Update page opening takes it away.
//!
//! Unlike the large pop-ups it is not modal: it takes no input and pauses nothing, over
//! play as over the menus. It enters in [`ENTER`] seconds, sliding down and growing to
//! its size while a ring sweeps round the medallion, light bursts from it (a glow, a
//! ring of light, sparks) and a glint crosses the card; it holds [`HOLD`] seconds and
//! fades out in [`LEAVE`]. The light is gold, a holocron's in its tier's colour. Several
//! unlocks queue and show one after another, each with its sound.
//!
//! The top centre is free in play: the HUDs' gauges sit in the bottom corners,
//! timers at the top right, notify lines at the top left, centre prints and the
//! crosshair lower (`version_overlay.rs`), so the card covers neither the aim nor the
//! chat. It waits while the console is open, a large pop-up shows or the window is away
//! (alt-tabbed out or minimised), and its clock runs only while it is drawn, so a card
//! is never spent unseen: a card hidden half way resumes where it was, and a long frame
//! (a hitch, a map loading, a minimised window drawing nothing) moves it on by at most
//! [`MAX_STEP`]. It draws nothing, nor allocates, while no unlock waits.
