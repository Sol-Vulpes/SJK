//! The boombox, SJK's toy (`toy_boombox`; Sol's idea, 25/10/2026): a big 80s stereo the
//! player carries on the shoulder ([`MODEL`]), playing music from the player's own
//! pk3s, which the SJK players standing close hear.
//!
//! - **Tracks** are files in the game data, as emotes are: `sound/boombox/<id>.mp3` (or
//!   `.wav`) in any pk3 or the game folder ([`load`]). `<id>` is 1 to 24 of `a` to `z`,
//!   `0` to `9` and `_`; the title shown is the id with spaces for its `_`.
//! - **`toy_boombox`** puts the stereo on the shoulder and plays the chosen track (the
//!   first one at first), or takes it off. `boombox` ([`TRACK_COMMAND`]) lists the
//!   tracks, and `boombox <id>`, `next`, `prev`, `play` and `stop` choose and play them.
//! - **Verified players only** (Sol's rule, 25/10/2026): on a server, only a player
//!   whose key the SJK hub verified may turn it on, and every SJK client ignores the
//!   boombox of a player the hub does not show as verified. In a local game anyone may.
//! - **Heard close by:** the player sets how far it carries ([`RANGE_CVAR`], from
//!   [`MIN_RANGE`] to [`MAX_RANGE`] units). It plays at full volume within a third of
//!   that and fades to nothing at the edge; a listener further away does not play it
//!   at all.
//! - **On the floor** (after VisionJK's boombox, by Blackwolf; Sol's go, 03/11/2026):
//!   [`PLACE_COMMAND`] stands the stereo on the floor in front of the player (or under
//!   them with no floor ahead), facing the way they look, and again picks it back up onto
//!   the shoulder. The music then plays from the box, with the same range, quieter behind
//!   it ([`BEHIND_SHARE`], [`heard_from`]). One box a player; it goes when picked up, with
//!   the toy turned off, on a new map or server, and when its owner leaves or drops off
//!   the hub.
//!
//! No game server knows of it, and the hub never carries sound. The stereo is a toy in
//! the player's look (`looks.rs`, [`TOY`]), so every SJK player on the server draws it on
//! their shoulder; what plays travels through the toy relay (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Toy
//! relay"): `play_<moment>_<bytes>_<range>_<id>` names the track, its file's size and
//! the game server's time it started at, `stop` ends it. The carrier's client tells each
//! SJK player who comes within reach, one event every [`SEND_GAP`], and again every
//! [`RETELL`]. A listener plays the track from where it is now (the server's time minus
//! the start) when they have a file of that id and size, and says once in the console
//! which track they lack otherwise; a track not told again for [`LOST`] stops. A box on
//! the floor is told to every SJK player on the server, before its music and again every
//! [`RETELL`]: `put_<x>_<y>_<z>_<yaw>` (the floor point in whole units, each client
//! finding the floor under it itself, and the way it faces in degrees), `take` when it
//! is picked up; one not told again for [`LOST`] goes.
