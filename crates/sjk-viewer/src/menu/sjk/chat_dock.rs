//! The SJK chat docked on a page (`docs/hub-chat.md`, "In the menus"): under the
//! servers on the main page ([`super::home`]) and under the match on the in-game menu
//! (`ingame_menu/sjk_view.rs`), drawn by one piece of code for both. Its name and who
//! is online, the last messages in a box of fixed height (each wrapped onto as many
//! rows as it needs, newest at the bottom), a field to type in and Open chat for the
//! page. Resting the pointer on a name shows the sender's card with Mute.
//!
//! [`DockCache`] reads the identity service only when the chat or the mute list
//! changed: its last lines, who is online and why it cannot send or read. Muted
//! senders' lines are left out. [`Dock`] is what a page keeps between frames: what is
//! being typed, the sender card on show and which messages the last frame showed.
