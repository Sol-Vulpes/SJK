//! The SJK UI's main page: SJK's emblem in its turning holo ring over the live
//! map, the menu on an arc round the ring's right side, and the servers the
//! player joined last in a column on the right, each joined with one click.
//!
//! The ring's gold arc points at the chosen entry. Play, SJK and Quit open
//! pages of their own on the same ring (the arc swaps to their entries, as
//! retail's pages swapped inside one frame); Profile and Settings open their
//! screens. Escape leaves a page for the main one, and on the main one asks to
//! quit.
//!
//! Under the servers, the SJK chat is docked (`docs/hub-chat.md`): its last lines,
//! who is online, a field to type in and Open chat for its page.
//!
//! Keys: Up and Down move along the arc, Enter takes the entry, Right (or Tab)
//! moves to the servers and Left (or Escape) back; Down past the last server
//! reaches the chat, where Enter starts typing (Enter sends, Escape stops). The
//! pointer chooses by hovering and acts with a click.
//!
//! The page is laid out on a 16:9 frame of 1080-line pixels centred in the
//! window: a wider window shows more map at the sides, a narrower one scales
//! the frame down to fit its width.
