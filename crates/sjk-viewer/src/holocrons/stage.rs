//! The Holocrons tab's 3D holocron ([`crate::console::holocrons_panel`]): one holocron floating in
//! the world behind the tab, over the left of the screen where the page leaves it clear.
//! It turns and bobs as Illuminate's does ([`crate::illuminate`]), wears the look of the
//! tier chosen in the list (that tier's model and shader, and a point light in the tier's
//! colour) and, for a tier the player holds none of, the locked look: the face drained
//! and dark, with a faint light (padlock-like dimming; it is never hidden, so every tier
//! can be seen).
//!
//! It is an ordinary object of the world pass: an instance of the look's model in
//! `object_groups`, loaded with the map's other rigid models ([`models`]), and a point
//! light, so the menu map's stage (the Character tab's) is not needed: it floats before
//! the backdrop camera ([`place`]), which the tab asks to park on its own shot
//! ([`crate::menu_backdrop::Shot::Holocrons`]). Over a match (the game menu's Profile
//! screen) it floats before the game's camera.
//!
//! A tier is a model of its own because a surface's shader is named by its model file
//! (`scripts/holocron_assets.py` writes `holocron_<tier>.md3` naming
//! `models/sjk/holocron_<tier>`); the shared `holocron.md3` would draw the base look for
//! every tier.
//!
//! Changing the tier shrinks the old look away and grows the new one ([`Stage`]); the
//! frame allocates nothing.
