//! The SJK UI's in-game menu (`docs/sjk-ui.md`, In-game menu): Escape in a
//! match keeps the match drawing and lays a dark fade over its left side, with
//! a compact version of the main page's arc of entries on it (the chosen one
//! gold and larger, a line under it saying what it opens, a lit rail beside
//! them with a gold mark at the chosen one, SJK's emblem inside the curve), a
//! card of the match on the right with the player's side and the vote on it, a
//! row of small icon buttons under the emblem, the SJK chat docked under the match
//! between them (the main page's dock, `menu::sjk::chat_dock`), the player's profile
//! card bottom left (a click opens the Profile screen) and the keys at the bottom.
//!
//! The pages are the in-game menu's own ([`Page`]): the main one, Team (the J
//! key's, or Siege's classes), Players (a small scoreboard, drawn as a table with
//! the chosen player's card on the right) and its Report page, the call-vote lists
//! and Leave. The main page's row and card controls are `sjk_focus.rs`'s model,
//! drawn by [`dock`]. Their rows
//! are the shared ones where they are the same (Siege's, the call-vote
//! lists') and this module's where they differ ([`prepare`]); what a row does
//! is in `sjk_actions.rs` and, for the shared pages, `game_menu_actions.rs`.
//!
//! Positions are pixels of the SJK UI's 16:9 frame ([`Frame`]).
