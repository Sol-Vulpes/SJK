//! The roster is read from the session when the page opens and once a second while it
//! shows ([`State::refresh`]): each connected client's name, team and bot flag from its
//! config string, its score and ping from the last `scores` the server sent, and what
//! the SJK hub knows of it (its key, verified or not) from the identity service's
//! presence list. A player chosen for a report is copied ([`State::choose`]), so the

//!
//! Only a verified SJK player may report ([`Gate`]); the others see the list, and the
//! Report page's reasons dimmed with why.
