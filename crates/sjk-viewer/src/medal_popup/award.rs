//! A new medal's ceremony, shared by the pop-up's two looks (`sjk_view.rs`,
//! `classic_view.rs`): when it is, and how the medal and its light are drawn.
//!
//! The achievement pop-up's card (`achievement_toast.rs`) is small and brief; a medal
//! is rarer and given by hand, so it takes the middle of the screen. Over
//! [`ENTRANCE`] seconds the whole medal comes down into place on its ribbon, growing
//! from a third of its size past its own and settling (ease-out, a little overshoot);
//! as it lands, light bursts from the medallion (a glow, two gold rings running out,
//! a flash and sparks thrown out and falling), a gold arc sweeps round it and leaves a
//! ring of ticks (the main page's ring, turning as slowly), a band of light crosses
//! the medal, and the words fade up one after another: what it is, the name, what it
//! is for and when it was given, the team's note, then the button and its key. While
//! it waits, it breathes: the glow swells and fades, a softer band of light crosses
//! it every [`GLINT_PERIOD`] seconds and a few sparkles twinkle round it. On Next or
//! Close everything lifts away and fades in [`EXIT`] seconds.
//!
//! Everything is a draw-list primitive whose number is fixed (no allocation, a
//! bounded count of sparks and sparkles), sized from the medal's own size so either
//! look can place it. Every moment is a function of the seconds since the medal
//! arrived, so the pop-up can be held still at any of them for its tests and shots.
