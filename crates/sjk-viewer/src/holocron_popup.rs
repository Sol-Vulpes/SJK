//! The holocron drop pop-up (`docs/holocrons.md`, "The pop-up"): the first time the client
//! sees a holocron in the player's own profile, it shows it once, large, in its tier's
//! colour with its name, when it was found and how rare it is. Several show one after
//! another ("1 of 3"). It follows the medal pop-up ([`crate::medal_popup`]), whose
//! ceremony it borrows:
//!
//! - When: on the main menu, or when the game menu opens in a match, never over play. A
//!   holocron that arrives during a match is announced once by a card at the top of the
//!   screen, as an achievement is ([`crate::unlock_toast`]), saying where to see it; the
//!   pop-up waits for the game menu and takes the card back as it opens. While it shows,
//!   the menu under it is not drawn and takes no input. A new medal goes first.
//! - What was shown is kept in `holocrons_seen.txt` ([`crate::holocrons::seen`]): the
//!   highest holocron number shown, so each shows once per identity, and an install that
//!   already held holocrons when it first read its profile shows the newest 20.
//! - Each arrives in a short ceremony with the multiplayer game's fanfare (the medals'
//!   cue): it comes down into place in a burst of light, its words fade up, and it
//!   breathes while it waits. Enter, Space, Right, Escape or a click finishes the ceremony
//!   at once; once it stands still they act as its button, Next (or Close on the last).
//! - One look serves every menu style ([`view`]): the SJK UI's, in its families once they
//!   load, else Inter.
//!
//! `debug_holocron` ([`crate::holocrons::rehearsal`]) queues made-up holocrons through the
//! same queue, so the whole flow can be tried offline; those are never written to
//! `holocrons_seen.txt`.
