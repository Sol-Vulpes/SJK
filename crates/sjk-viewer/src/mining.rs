//! Mining, SJK's own toy (`toy_mining`; vinry's idea, built by Slash, 04/11/2026, phase
//! 1): the player takes a pickaxe in hand, and boulders come up out of the ground round
//! them, a few at a time ([`ROCKS`]). The player walks up to one and strikes it with the
//! attack button (or `+use`), the whole body
//! in the swing (`BOTH_A3_T__B_`, the strong saber style's blow from overhead, the
//! pickaxe held as a hilt is); ten to fourteen blows
//! break it, and it gives rubble or ore, counted in the player's mining log
//! (`mining_log.txt`). Another boulder comes up elsewhere 4 to 8 seconds later. Now and then
//! a glint flashes on a boulder being broken: a blow that lands while it shines is a clean
//! strike, worth two, and any makes the boulder give better ([`roll_find`]).
//!
//! Unlike Fishing it is no waiting game: the player walks from boulder to boulder, and
//! the pace is theirs, a swing at a time. Attacking, taking damage or dying puts the
//! pickaxe away.
//!
//! Phase 1 changes nothing at the hub: the finds are a local log, no credits, no
//! shards, no achievements. Selling them (phase 2) is to share the Fishing junk's daily
//! cap (`fishing_sell.rs`), one cap for both, so mining earns nothing more than fishing
//! does alone.
//!
//! No game server knows of it: it travels through the SJK hub as a toy in the player's
//! look ([`TOY`]), so other SJK players see the pickaxe in their hand (at rest: swings are
//! not sent); the boulders are the miner's own, seen by no one else. Players on stock
//! clients see a player with empty hands.
//!
//! The models, pictures, shader and icon are bundled ([`FILES`], made by
//! `scripts/mining_assets.py`) and mounted below all game data. The sounds are retail
//! game paths.
