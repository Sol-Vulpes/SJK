//! The SJK UI's scoreboard (`cg_scoreboardStyle sjk`, or `auto` with the SJK
//! UI's menus): the match's columns floating over the game dimmed behind them,
//! in the UI's families and colours, with no panel or box (`docs/sjk-ui.md`,
//! Scoreboard).
//!
//! It is laid out on the UI's 16:9 frame ([`Frame`]). A header line runs across
//! the top as the other screens' top bar does: the map, the mode with its
//! limits, the time and your place ("3rd of 14"), the screen's one memorable
//! thing, in gold. The columns stand right of the chat column, which the
//! scoreboard keeps for messages (`chat::view`): one list in free-for-all (two
//! side by side once rows would be too thin), the two teams side by side in
//! team games, each under its score with a thin rule in a muted team colour, and
//! in duels the duelists as two facing cards over the players waiting their
//! turn. Compact (`cg_compactScoreboard`, the default) packs the rows thinner
//! so a full server stays in one column, and sizes the lists from what they
//! show rather than the screen: the name column as wide as the longest name
//! (within bounds), the numbers right after it, the whole board centred on the
//! screen as far as the chat column allows ([`Board`]). Spectators share one
//! line at the bottom. Your row is on the UI's gold
//! band with gold accents; bots and spectators are quieter.
//!
//! Nothing here allocates: runs are formatted into the canvas's retained
//! slots, and measured text goes through a fixed buffer ([`Short`]).
