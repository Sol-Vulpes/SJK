//! MMO-style nameplates over players (and, optionally, NPCs).
//!
//! Far away a player shows only a small, dim name. Closer, the name rises and a
//! framed plate fades in beneath it with health, shield and Force bars, and the
//! weapon the player holds beside it, haloed in the saber stance's colour.
//! Names come from the chat roster and are drawn in the classic HUD font with
//! their colour codes; the layout maths is in [`super::nameplate_math`]. What the
//! server does not send is estimated, once per snapshot: Force in
//! [`super::force_estimate`], health and shield in [`super::vitals_estimate`],
//! each as a range whose uncertainty the bar shows as a grey haze. The plain
//! TaystJK names stay in [`super::identification`] (`cg_drawPlayerNames`); a
//! nameplate replaces them.
