//! The drop pop-up's look (`docs/holocrons.md`, "The pop-up"): the screen darkens and the
//! holocron floats in the middle of it in its tier's colour, in a ring of ticks, with the
//! words centred under it in the SJK UI's families (Inter until they load) and its button
//! from the kit (gold, Next or Close), the key bottom right as on the other screens. It is
//! drawn the same under the SJK UI and the classic menus. Laid out on the UI's 16:9 frame
//! in 1080-line pixels.
//!
//! The ceremony is the medal pop-up's ([`crate::medal_popup::award`]) in the tier's
//! colour: the holocron comes down into place, a burst of light leaves it (a glow, two
//! rings, sparks), a ring of ticks turns round it and a soft glow breathes while it waits;
//! the words fade up one group after another. Everything is a draw-list primitive of a fixed
//! number, so a frame allocates nothing.
