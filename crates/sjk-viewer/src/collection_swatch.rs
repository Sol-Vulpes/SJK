//! The Collection's live swatches (its Shaders tab, and the Profile screen's Saber
//! tab): each blade skin drawn small with the UI's shapes, moving as it does in the
//! game. A blade skin lies across its swatch from a
//! steel hilt, drawn from its loaded blade-skin file (`blade_skin_file.rs`): a hot core
//! in a corona graded from the file's inside colour to its rim, breathing as its light
//! flickers in a soft haze, flame loops rising off it, granules drifting along it and,
//! when the skin has flares, now and then a bright flare running from the hilt to the
//! tip (as `saber.wgsl` animates the real blade), and, when the skin has them, lightning
//! arcs flashing off it, motes drifting round it and its colours turning through their
//! hues, and the later sections' looks ([`effects`]). A locked one is drawn grey and
//! still, under a padlock; an owned one whose pack has not come yet is drawn still in
//! neutral grey.
