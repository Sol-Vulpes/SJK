//! The low-FPS help (`docs/client.md`, "Low FPS help"): SJK's real-time lighting is
//! most of what a heavy map costs, and EJK graphics turn it off. A few seconds after
//! a server's map is in, the GPU times of some frames ([`crate::gpu_phases`]) say
//! whether the frame misses the player's FPS target with the lighting a large part of
//! it; then a card over the game menu ([`card`]) offers EJK graphics, once per map,
//! until the player ticks "Don't suggest this again" (`cg_fpsHelp 0`). `help_fps`
//! opens the same card at any time, with this map's numbers when it has them.
