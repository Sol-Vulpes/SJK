//! The loot table's odds (`docs/holocrons.md`, "Loot table"), worked out from the hub's
//! tables ([`crate::loot_odds`]): how often a drop is each tier, the card inside a
//! holocron of each tier and its credits. A card's rarity and its finish
//! are rolled apart, so the chance of a kind is the two multiplied; "per holocron found"
//! weighs each tier by how often it drops, and counts the openings that bring a saber
//! shader or a pile of kyber shards instead of the card and its credits ([`card_in`]).
//! Every chance is 0 to 1.
