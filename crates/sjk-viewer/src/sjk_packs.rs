//! SJK's own content packs (`docs/unlockables.md`, "Packs"): PK3s the SJK hub serves to
//! SJK clients, holding the art of unlockables (blade-skin files, their sounds and
//! images) under "all rights reserved", apart from SJK's open code. The identity
//! service downloads them into the `assets/` folder beside `identity.key`
//! (`sjk_identity::assets`); this module mounts what is there.
//!
//! At start every cached pack is mounted (whether the identity is on or not: the
//! content is SJK's own and already on the player's machine), and again whenever the
//! service writes a new one ([`follow_identity`]). Mounting reads the packs' blade-skin
//! files into the process-wide [`LoadedSkins`], which each world's `GpuState` takes
//! (uploading the skins' parameters and pairs and registering their sounds) the next
//! frame its generation differs ([`generation`]). The game's own file system also
//! mounts the cached packs, below all game data like the holocron
//! ([`mount_below_game_data`]), so a PK3 with the same paths replaces their files.
