//! Keep the player's Force profile legal for the current server.
//!
//! The user's preferred `forcepowers` is a client setting; what goes on the
//! wire is a per-server legalized copy. `WP_InitForcePowers`
//! (`codemp/game/w_force.c:240-251`) strips disabled or over-budget powers,
//! and (`w_force.c:368-392`) parks any client whose profile needed stripping
//! — or whose session has not yet confirmed its powers (`!sess.setForce`) —
//! in spectator mode with `spc` + `nfr <rank> 1 <team>`: the stock "Force menu
//! on first join". [`enter_play`] sends the legalized value and then the
//! stock Force menu's own accept command, `forcechanged "<TEAM>"`, while the
//! client is still the spectator it connects as; `Cmd_ForceChanged_f`
//! (`codemp/game/g_cmds.c:1276-1313`) runs `WP_InitForcePowers` immediately,
//! marks the session and joins the team, so play starts without a bounce
//! (verified against JA+ 2.4 on the EFF server,
//! `target/parity-reports/playtest-japlus5`).
//!
//! When a server still sends `nfr <rank> 1 <team>`, stock JKA opens the Force
//! menu; closing it flushes the legalized userinfo, sends `forcechanged`, and
//! the player clicks Join again (`assets1.pk3:ui/jamp/ingame_playerforce.menu:
//! 1556-1562`). [`ForceProfileNegotiator`] performs those steps itself. Because
//! `Cmd_Team_f` refuses a second team change within five seconds of the first
//! (`codemp/game/g_cmds.c:998-1001`, `1031`), the join is retried a bounded
//! number of times, except in duel and power duel, where waiting as a
//! spectator is the queue: there `SetTeam` keeps a queued player spectating
//! but announces and respawns them on every request (`g_cmds.c:829-841`,
//! `906`, `922`), and `Cmd_Team_f` refuses any change in power duel
//! (`g_cmds.c:1016-1022`).
//!
//! The value sent is always the player's own `forcepowers` fitted to the
//! server's current rules ([`ForceLegalizeRules::for_sent_profile`]), worked
//! out each time the userinfo is built, so a profile applied in play is the
//! one the server receives. A server reads a changed profile only when told
//! to: `Cmd_ForceChanged_f` re-reads it at once for a spectator and at the
//! next respawn in play (`forceDoInit`, `g_cmds.c:1276-1296`,
//! `g_client.c:3174-3178`), so an applied profile is followed by
//! `forcechanged` ([`ForceProfileNegotiator::profile_applied`]), as stock
//! `UI_UpdateClientForcePowers` does (`codemp/ui/ui_force.c`).
