//! Turning one diffuse texture into its material maps.
//!
//! All steps are deterministic and wrap around the texture edges
//! ([`crate::filters`]), so a tiling texture gives tiling maps.
//!
//! 1. **Height from albedo.** Luminance (Rec. 709 weights on the stored sRGB
//!    values) is high-passed twice at [`GRADIENT_RADIUS`] (32 texels at 256
//!    texels, scaled with the texture): lighting gradients baked into the
//!    paint over an eighth of the texture or more are suppressed. The rest
//!    is split into band-pass layers between wrap-around Gaussian blurs of
//!    radius 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 texels at 256, summed with [`BANDS`]'
//!    weights, so pixel noise counts less than shapes. The sum is centred on
//!    its 2nd–98th percentile range and scaled to 0–1. Low-contrast textures
//!    are not stretched beyond [`MIN_HEIGHT_RANGE`], so flat paint stays flat.
//!    The class's `fine_detail` weighs the two finest bands (smooth metal keeps
//!    little of the texel grain). Bright is high unless the class's `relief`
//!    says otherwise or, left to `auto`, the paint's own top light clearly shows
//!    the bright parts recessed ([`painted_relief`]): then the height is turned
//!    upside down.
//! 2. **Normal.** Scharr derivatives of the height, times the class's normal
//!    strength and the `--strength` factor, give the normal
//!    `normalize(-k·dh/ds, -k·dh/dt, 1)`. Up to [`SLOPE_REFERENCE`] (512)
//!    texels slopes are per texel. Larger textures, usually high-resolution
//!    replacements covering the same wall as the retail texture, measure them
//!    per 1/512 of the texture over a lightly blurred height, so their texel
//!    noise is not steepened. Red follows +s (right), green +t
//!    (down the image): the tangent frame of rend2 and of JKR's material
//!    program. Encoded as `round((n * 0.5 + 0.5) * 255)`, so flat is
//!    (128, 128, 255).
//! 3. **Packed roughness, metalness, occlusion** (`_rmo`, red, green, blue):
//!    the class's base roughness, moved by local luminance variation (busier is
//!    rougher), brightness (brighter is smoother) and cavities (rougher); the
//!    class's metalness on bright unsaturated texels only (paint and grime are
//!    not metal); occlusion darkens cavities of the height by the class's
//!    occlusion strength.
//!
//! Alpha-tested textures use their alpha as a mask: transparent texels add
//! nothing to the blurs, get a flat normal, and the normal map keeps the
//! source alpha. They never get parallax height.
