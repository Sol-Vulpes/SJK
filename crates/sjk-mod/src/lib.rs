//! The interface between SJK and its client mods.
//!
//! A mod is a set of console commands and settings that live outside the core
//! client. Every name a mod owns starts with its id and a dot (`japlus.guntele`,
//! `japlus.loginServer1`), and its commands exist only on the servers it is made
//! for ([`ClientMod::loads_on`]) and while the player leaves it on (`mod_<id>`, on
//! by default). A mod reaches the game through [`Host`] alone: it sends server
//! commands and reads what the client already knows (the crosshair point, the
//! predicted player, the drawn players), and never touches the renderer, the
//! prediction or the wire directly.
//!
//! The mods are built into the client (see `docs/mods.md`); this crate is the line
//! they are written against.
