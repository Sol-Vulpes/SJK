//! Player identity for SJK: an Ed25519 key the player keeps, and the client side
//! of the SJK hub's protocol (`PROTOCOL.md` in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub) that turns it
//! into a profile and a badge on game servers.
//!
//! The crate has no window, renderer or game-network knowledge. The viewer
//! creates a [`Service`], feeds it the player's [`Settings`] and [`Location`],
//! and reads its [`Snapshot`].
