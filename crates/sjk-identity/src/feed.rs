//! The hub's feed (`PROTOCOL.md`, "The feed"): a thread of its own that holds a long
//! poll open at the hub and keeps the SJK chat's last messages and online count, and
//! the emotes and looks received, so the identity worker's claims and reports never
//! wait behind it.
//!
//! The worker tells it, through [`FeedShared`], which hub to read (only while the
//! identity is on and the hub answered the registration, and then while the player
//! is on a game server or the chat is on), which game server's emotes and looks to ask
//! for, and whether the chat shows. With the chat off the feed still reads on a game
//! server, for the looks and emotes, but keeps no message: [`ChatState`] stays as an
//! idle feed leaves it. With no hub to read it makes no request.
//!
//! A holocron drop (`PROTOCOL.md`, "The feed") joins the chat's messages in the feed's
//! order as a [`ChatMessage`] whose [`ChatMessage::holocron`] is set, so the game's
//! chat, the docked chat and the chat page show it where it was said. A drop of the
//! player's own key also tells the identity worker ([`OwnDrop`]), which reads the own
//! profile and holocron progress again soon.
//!
//! Another game server starts the reading again from `after` 0, whose answer carries
//! that server's looks of the last minute. The looks queued for the viewer carry the
//! server they were read for and the reading's generation ([`FeedShared::generation`],
//! which changes with the hub, the server or the identity going off or on), and
//! [`take_looks`] hands over only those of the current generation and the viewer's
//! server, so a poll still under way when either changed cannot bring old looks back.
