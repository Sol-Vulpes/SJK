# Sol JK (SJK)

**Sol JK**, or **SJK** for short, is Sol's client for **Star Wars Jedi
Knight: Jedi Academy** multiplayer: the game as Sol sees it, developed by Sol in
Rust.

SJK aims to be a true JKA+: everything players expect from today's community
clients, from the retail look and feel to mod servers such as JA+ and modern
screens, in a client that stays clean and fast, without the bloat some clients
have accumulated. Once the client is solid, a JoF edition of SJK will follow.

SJK includes a graphical client and a dedicated server, with support for the
legacy protocol, PK3 content, maps, models, movement and combat. The renderer
uses wgpu. The client includes a server browser, console, configurable controls,
HUD, audio, screenshots and demo playback.

## Highlights

- the SJK UI, SJK's own menus over the live map, the default;
- a classic menu style after the retail menus: main, profile, setup, controls
  and server browser pages, retail connect and loading screens, the animated
  logo and glows with the SJK emblem in the ring, and no map behind the menu;
- a classic scoreboard with client IDs, and HUDs drawn from the game's own menu
  files, so the retail HUD and custom HUD packs work;
- JA+ support: the client identifies as the JA+ plugin, predicts JA+ movement,
  saber rules, `g_debugMelee`, the grapple and duel pass-through, and adds
  `serverconfig` and `pluginDisable`;
- vector versions of the retail game fonts on every retail text surface, tighter
  console and chat rows, and text that scales at high resolutions;
- a renderer settings page, sharp levelshots, and MOUSE1, MOUSE2 and ESC locked
  in the controls editor;
- more reliable joining of public servers (lost handshake packets and lost
  gamestates are recovered) and support for older 72-bone player models;
- an FPS cap that follows the monitor's refresh rate by default and holds its
  exact rate;
- optional rend2-style material maps for world surfaces, with a local generator;
- gameplay and presentation fixes (third-person camera, Force Speed afterimages,
  saber trails, death animations, key names for non-US keyboard layouts and
  more);
- a personal `debug_panel` console command: an in-game checklist of the changes
  in this build and how to test them.

Sol (Sol-Vulpes) develops SJK and decides where it goes. Contributors send pull
requests, Creyon first among them; see [CREDITS.md](CREDITS.md).

The programs are `sjk` (the game) and `sjk-server` (the dedicated server).
Settings have neutral engine names (`r_*`, `cg_*`), the source crates are
`sjk-*`, and the client's own folder is `GameData/SJK/`.

## Download

Ready-to-run Windows x64 and Linux x64 builds are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/Sol-Vulpes/SJK/releases) and the
[SJK website](https://sol-vulpes.github.io/SJK/). Extract the ZIP for your
platform into Jedi Academy's `GameData` folder, beside `base`, and launch
`sjk` (`sjk.exe` on Windows).

Releases are built by the [SJK release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml)
when a tag named `sjk-v<version>` (for example `sjk-v0.2.0`) is pushed. It builds
the same drop-in ZIPs as the [GameData packages workflow](docs/packages.md),
smoke check included, names them `SJK-<version>-<platform>.zip`, and publishes
them with their checksums and the matching source snapshot.

## Build

Install Rust 1.88 or newer, Cargo, a C/C++ compiler, CMake and pkg-config.
On Linux, development packages for ALSA, Wayland and XKB are required, along
with working Vulkan or OpenGL graphics drivers.

```sh
cargo build --release -p sjk-viewer -p sjk-dedicated
```

This builds `target/release/sjk` and `target/release/sjk-server` (`.exe` on
Windows).

SJK is developed and tested mainly on Windows 11. It keeps its Linux support,
but changes are not routinely tested there.

## Game data

A legally obtained Jedi Academy installation is required. Put `sjk`
(`sjk.exe` on Windows) in its `GameData` directory, beside the `base`
folder containing `assets0.pk3` through `assets3.pk3`.
Game data is not included in this repository.

## Client

Launch the client from that folder or a shortcut to open the main menu. No
game-data path, environment variable or particular working directory is needed.
Put `sjk-server` (`sjk-server.exe` on Windows) beside it too for Create game
and local `devmap` support.

Connect directly to a server:

```sh
./sjk --connect 127.0.0.1:29070
```

If keeping the binary elsewhere, use `JKA_GAME_DATA=/path/to/GameData` or the
saved game-data setting; known installation locations are also checked. The
explicit positional form `sjk /path/to/GameData --connect HOST:PORT`
remains supported. See [client launch](docs/client.md#launch) for discovery order.
Use the in-game menus for controls, graphics, audio and player settings;
Settings > Interface > Menu style, or First setup's first row, switches
between the SJK UI and the classic menus.

Settings and player-created files live in `GameData/SJK/`: `config.cfg`,
`marks.txt`, favorites, friends, screenshots, demos and optional chat logs.
If that directory cannot be written, the client uses its per-user folder
instead. The console's `path` command shows the
active location. See [configuration and content](docs/client.md#configuration-and-content).

## Dedicated server

```sh
./target/release/sjk-server \
  --game-data /path/to/GameData \
  --map mp/ffa3 \
  --bind 0.0.0.0:29070 \
  --hostname "SJK server"
```

Server configuration uses familiar cvars and commands, including `+set` launch
arguments. For example, append `+set g_gametype 0 +set fraglimit 20` for a
free-for-all match. UDP port 29070 must be reachable for remote players to join.

## Source layout

All source is under `crates/`:

- `sjk-viewer`: graphical client and platform integration (builds `sjk`).
- `sjk-dedicated`: dedicated server and game integration (builds `sjk-server`).
- `sjk-game-jka`: shared Jedi Academy game rules and movement.
- `sjk-client`, `sjk-network`, `sjk-protocol`: client state and legacy networking.
- `sjk-bsp`, `sjk-scene`, `sjk-runtime`: maps, scene data and world state.
- `sjk-materialgen`: offline generator of local material maps from installed
  textures (see [rendering](docs/rendering.md#generating-material-maps)).
- Remaining crates provide formats, content loading, collision, navigation,
  scripting, audio, UI and the console.

Legacy formats and game-specific behavior stay in compatibility modules;
engine services use their own data structures.

The [project wiki](docs/README.md) covers architecture, development, the client, the dedicated server, rendering
and networking. Start with [current status and priorities](docs/status.md) for
verified behavior and open work. [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) contains shared
contributor and AI guidance, including updating relevant documentation alongside
