# SJK chat and emotes

SJK chat is one conversation for every SJK player, carried by the SJK hub
(`cl_hubUrl`, sjk.dfox.app) instead of the game server: it reaches SJK players on
any server, or in the menus with no server at all, and players on stock clients
never see it. Emotes ride the same hub connection so SJK players on one game server
see each other's emotes; the emotes themselves (animations, sounds, art) are
separate work, and SJK only has the path for them so far. The feed also carries the
players' looks (blade skin and Illuminate, [unlockables.md](unlockables.md)), so it
reads on a game server even with the chat off.

Status (08/10/2026): built on `personal/sjk-chat` (client) and `feat/chat-emotes`
(Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub), designed with Sol the same day; the hub's side is not deployed.
See [Verification](#verification) for what was checked.

The hub's side is described in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Chat", "Emotes" and
"The feed"). Chat and emotes are signed by the player's identity key and need
`cl_identity 1` ([identity.md](identity.md)).

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Who may write | Any registered SJK key; reading the feed needs a registered key too. |
| History | In the hub's memory only: the last 200 messages, gone on a restart. |
| Menus | A docked box on the SJK UI's main page and in-game menu, and a full SJK chat page. |
| Emote ids | Open: the hub relays any well-formed id; the catalogue is client data. |

## Hub protocol (additions to version 1)

Old clients ignore all of it, so it stays `/v1/`.

- `POST /v1/chat` `{"text":"..","name":".."}` (`name`, the in-game name worn, is
  optional and joins the key's worn names). The text: one line (`chat_lines`), runs
  of spaces made one and the ends trimmed, 1 to 150 characters (`chat_length`) of the
  bio's alphabet with `^` only before a digit (`chat_characters`), no run of one
  character longer than 8 (`chat_noise`). A key sends at most one message every 2
  seconds and 15 a minute (`chat_quota`), not the same text twice within 30 seconds
  (`chat_duplicate`); a muted key is refused (`chat_muted`).
- `POST /v1/emote` `{"server":"ip:port","emote":".."}`: the key needs a live claim on
  the server (`not_on_server`), and the hub takes the slot and claimed name from it,
  so a key emotes only for the slot it claims. Ids are 1 to 32 of `a`-`z`, `0`-`9`,
  `_` (`bad_emote`); at most one every 2 seconds (`emote_quota`). An emote lives 10
  seconds.
- `GET /v1/feed?after=<id>&server=<ip:port>&wait=<0..25>`, signed. Messages, emotes
  and deletions share one id sequence. The hub answers as soon as it holds something
  newer than `after` for this reader, else after `wait` seconds:
  `{"next","chat":[..],"emotes":[..],"looks":[..],"deleted":[..],"online"}` (`looks`,
  the server's look events of the last 60 seconds, since unlocks and looks). `after` 0,
  or above the newest id (the hub restarted), gives the newest 50 messages, the
  server's looks of the last 60 seconds (looks are state) and no emotes.
  A key reads at most 40 times a minute (`feed_quota`); the feed (300 a minute) and chat
  and emotes (60 a minute) have per-address allowances of their own, so several players
  sharing an address fit and talking never spends what claims need.
- Moderation: a `chat_muted` flag on keys (the operator's `chat-mute` and
  `chat-unmute`, `{"chat_muted":true}` in the operator API) and two staff requests,
  `/v1/staff/chat-delete` `{"id"}` and `/v1/staff/chat-mute` `{"key_id","muted"}`,
  logged in the staff log (a deleted message's text with it).

## Client service

- Sending (`Service::chat`, `Service::emote`) goes through the identity worker; the
  rules are checked before anything is sent, as a bio's are. What became of the last
  message or emote is `ChatState::outcome`.
- `Service::start_with_feed` starts a second thread, `sjk-hub-feed`, with its own HTTP
  client (timeout 40 seconds), so the worker's claims and reports never wait behind
  the long poll. It reads only while the identity is on and the hub answered the
  registration, and then while the player is on a game server (whatever `cl_sjkChat`
  says, for the looks and emotes) or `cl_sjkChat` is on (`Service::set_chat`); in the
  menus with the chat off it makes no request. It polls at most every 2 seconds and
  backs off (2 to 60 seconds) when the hub fails. With the chat on it keeps the last
  200 messages, the online count and whether the last poll reached the hub
  (`ChatState`; `loaded` says when the hub being read first answered, so the game's
  feed marks that backlog instead of replaying it); with the chat off it keeps none of
  them, so `ChatState` stays as an idle feed leaves it and nothing shows, and turning
  the chat on starts again from the backlog. Either way it queues up to 64 received
  emotes (`Service::take_emotes`) and 64 looks (`Service::take_looks`). A new hub, or
  ids that go backwards (the hub restarted), start from the backlog; another game
  server starts again from `after` 0, whose answer brings that server's looks of the
  last minute. The looks keep the server they were read for and the reading's
  generation (it changes with the hub, the server or the identity going off or on):
  `Service::take_looks` hands over only the current generation's for the viewer's
  server, so a poll under way at a change brings no old look.
- Shutting down tells the feed thread to stop; it ends after its poll without being
  waited for.

## In the game

- The chat overlay has a fourth channel, SJK. `messagemode5` (I by default in a new
  profile or a whole imported config, when I is free and nothing is bound to
  `messagemode5`; an existing profile binds it in Settings > Key bindings > Other)
  opens the composer on it; Tab cycles All, Team and SJK. Enter on SJK hands the text to the hub,
  never to the game server.
- Hub messages join the chat feed as one flowing line ([How a line
  looks](#how-a-line-looks)): a small SJK tag, the name, the verified tick for a
  verified sender, then the message in the SJK chat's gold. Texts go through
  `chat::for_display`, names through `chat::name_for_display`: a name keeps every
  character a Jedi Academy name can draw, all of Windows-1252 that prints (`{ }`,
  `\`, `` ` ``, Latin-1's symbols such as guillemets and the section sign, the
  bullet, dagger and trade mark), so clan tags show as worn (Sol's request,
  10/10/2026); the soft hyphen and what reorders or prints nothing stay out, as from
  a message, which keeps the bio's alphabet. Messages staff delete leave the feed,
  and muting a
  player ([Muting a player](#muting-a-player)) hides their lines already there. While
  the composer is open, resting the pointer on a sender's name shows their profile
  card with Mute or Unmute. Joining a game
  does not replay the hub's backlog in the feed (the dock and the page show it). A
  refusal (quota, rules) shows as an `SJK chat:` line.
- `cl_sjkChat` (default 1, Settings > Network > SJK chat) shows SJK chat and runs the
  feed; 0 hides it. On a game server the feed still reads, for the players' looks and
  emotes, but no message reaches the game's feed, the dock or the page; in the menus it
  stops.

## A sound for a new message

A new SJK chat message from another player plays a sound (Sol's request, 10/10/2026),
in the menus and in a game, wherever the chat is on. Before this, SJK chat messages
played nothing.

- **The sound** is a variant of JKA's chat sound, made from the game's own file when
  SJK starts: the player's `sound/player/talk` (`.wav`, else `.mp3`) is read through the
  game's file system and decoded as every sound is, then played 1.122 times faster (so
  higher and shorter, read through a band-limited windowed-sinc kernel), cut to 0.60
  seconds with its last 0.15 faded out linearly, given two echoes 70 and 140 ms later
  (0.3 and 0.15 of it beside 0.8 of itself, all times 0.6, not fed back) and brought to
  the talk sound's own level (times 1.5494): 0.74 seconds at 44.1 kHz
  ([sjk_chat_sound.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/audio/sjk_chat_sound.rs), `variant`). It
  is made once, on the audio's decode worker, when the audio first meets the game data
  (`configure_audio`), and kept in memory only. Nothing of JKA's audio ships with SJK;
  game data without the file makes no sound, said once in the log.
- **When:** a message newer than what the feed had already seen joins it
  (`ChatOverlay::sync_sjk`, [chat/sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat/sjk.rs)), so the
  backlog the hub sends at start, on a reconnection or from a new hub plays nothing, as
  it is not replayed in the game's feed either. Not for the player's own messages (any
  of their keys: their id at the hub, this PC's key, the keys linked to them), not for a
  player muted on this PC, not for holocron drops. At most once a second
  (`chat::sjk::SOUND_GAP`), so a burst plays it once.
- **How it plays:** as the game's chat beep does, beside the listener at full volume
  under `s_volume`, through the interface cues' mailbox (`ui_cues::Cue::SjkChat`) on a
  channel of its own, so it never cuts a menu sound or the game's beep.
- **Switches:** `cl_sjkChatSound` (archived, default 1; Settings > Network > SJK chat
  sound, under SJK chat, so in every settings screen and settings search). The master
  chat sound switch `cg_chatSounds` gates it too: 0 silences every chat sound, the
  game's `cg_chatBeep` and `cg_teamChatBeep` already, and SJK chat is chat. With
  `cl_sjkChat 0` no message arrives, so nothing plays.

## In the menus

- SJK UI main page: the chat is docked under Recent servers. Its last messages (the
  verified tick after a verified sender's name) sit on the field, newest at the bottom,
  with the online count by its name. The box keeps its height (five one-row messages)
  and each message takes as many rows as it needs (Sol's request, 10/10/2026: a long
  one was cut to one row), so a long message pushes older ones out; a message taller
  than the whole box (150 characters at a larger `ui_textScale`) shows its first rows
  with its name, the last one ending in an ellipsis, and Open chat shows the rest.
  Resting the pointer on a name shows the sender's sender card with Mute. Down past the
  last server (or a click) reaches the field; Enter types (every key goes to the
  field), Enter sends, Escape stops. Open chat opens the page. A line under the field
  says why a message could not go.
- SJK UI in-game menu (Escape in a match): the same dock, drawn by the same code
  ([chat_dock.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/chat_dock.rs)), under the match
  between the row of icons and the card ([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#in-game-menu)). Tab
  reaches its field after the card; Enter types, and while typing every key goes to
  the field, the console key and the game's bindings included; Escape stops typing.
  The sender card shows above the dock and says where the player is on the server.
  The classic in-game menu has no dock.
- The SJK chat page (a console page in the SJK UI's look in every menu style): the
  history, newest at the bottom, each a flowing line (name, tick, text) with Staff and
  how long ago on the right of its first row ("3 minutes ago", as the main page's
  servers say, so no time zone is needed); the field (the keyboard is there when the page opens), Send and the
  character count. Up from the field chooses the newest message, Up and Down move,
  Page Up and Page Down scroll, Tab walks every control. Resting the pointer on a name
  shows the sender's sender card with Mute or Unmute. A chosen message offers Mute on
  this PC ([Muting a player](#muting-a-player)); for staff, Delete for everyone, Mute at the hub and Unmute
  at the hub (the client does not know a key's mute flag); under them, what the request
  came to (sending, done, or the hub's refusal). It opens from the dock's
  Open chat, `sjkchat`, `messagemode5` outside a game, the classic in-game SJK menu's
  SJK chat and the SJK UI in-game menu's SJK chat icon.
  The page draws a copy of the chat taken under the identity's lock, never the chat
  itself: drawing asks for the player's own key (`printable_key_id`), which takes that
  lock again, and a lock held while drawing froze the game.

## GIFs from GIPHY

A GIPHY link in an SJK chat message shows its GIF (Sol's decision, 10/10/2026: "GIPHY
links should just display the GIF in chat (not through the hub)"). The hub carries only
the text, as for any message; each reader's client fetches the GIF from GIPHY itself.
Only GIPHY: Tenor's API shut down on 30/06/2026.

- **Links recognised** ([link.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_gifs/link.rs)): `https://`
  (or `http://`) with the host compared whole and lower-cased, no user or port:
  `giphy.com/gifs/<slug>-<id>` and `giphy.com/gifs/<id>` (also `stickers/`, and
  `www.giphy.com`), `giphy.com/embed/<id>`, `media.giphy.com` and `media0` to
  `media4.giphy.com` `/media/<id>/<file>`, with or without the `v1.<token>` segment of
  GIPHY's share links (`/media/v1.Y2lk.../<id>/giphy.gif?cid=...`), and
  `i.giphy.com/<id>.gif` (`.webp`) or `i.giphy.com/media/[v1.<token>/]<id>/<file>`. The
  query and fragment are ignored; punctuation ending a sentence after the link is not
  part of it; short links (`gph.is`) are not followed. The id must be 6 to 40 ASCII
  letters and digits with a capital or a digit among them (a slug word such as
  `birthday` is not an id). A message shows at most one GIF, its first link's; that link
  reads `GIF` in the line, and other links stay text.
- **What is fetched** ([fetch.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_gifs/fetch.rs)): never
  the pasted address. SJK rebuilds `https://media.giphy.com/media/<id>/200.gif` (the
  rendition 200 pixels high GIPHY makes for every GIF; a typical one is 0.2 to 0.6 MB)
  and checks it again before the request; only when GIPHY answers 404 for it,
  `https://media.giphy.com/media/<id>/giphy.gif`, the original. For an id it does not
  know, GIPHY answers the original with 200 and a "not found" picture of its own, marked
  with an `x-retry-not-found-metric` header (seen 10/10/2026), which SJK takes as a 404.
  HTTPS only, no redirect followed, 10 seconds for the whole request, at most 4 MiB read
  (more is refused), `Accept: image/gif`, the user agent `SJK/<version>`. No cookie, no
  key, nothing about the player is sent.
- **Decoding** ([decode.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_gifs/decode.rs)), on the
  `sjk-chat-gifs` worker thread, never on the frame thread, with the `image` crate's GIF
  decoder (its `gif` feature): a canvas over 2048 pixels a side is refused; each frame is
  composed as the file says and scaled to fit 480 pixels a side; an animation over 240
  frames or 32 MiB of RGBA keeps its first frame only, still. Delays under 20 ms are
  shown as 100 ms, as browsers do.
- **The cache** ([chat_gifs.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_gifs.rs)): decoded GIFs
  stay in memory only, by id, so a GIF in several messages loads once: at most 24 GIFs
  and 96 MiB of pixels, those used least recently dropped first (never one on screen).
  Nothing is written to disk. A GIF that could not be had is asked for again after five
  minutes. Eight GIFs can be drawn at once, each in a texture of its own made at its size
  ([gif_textures.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ui_renderer/gif_textures.rs)); once a frame
  each gets the frame of its animation, uploaded only when it changes, so a GIF on screen
  costs one small texture write per frame change and none otherwise. Every copy of a GIF
  plays in step.
- **How it shows** ([draw.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_gifs/draw.rs)): under the
  message's text, on the SJK chat page 160 pixels high (at 1080p) and on the docks 48, as
  wide as its shape makes it (a column too narrow makes it narrower and lower). While it
  loads, a quiet box of that height says "Loading GIF", so nothing moves when it comes;
  when it could not be had, one quiet line says "GIF unavailable". The docks' box keeps
  its height: a message with a GIF takes the room of three one-row messages, and older
  ones make room; a message taller than the box with its GIF shows its text without it.
  The in-game chat feed shows the link as text.
- **Muted players**: their GIFs are never fetched. The docks leave their lines out and
  the page shows "Muted on this PC" in place of the text, so their links are never read
  for a GIF (`chat_gifs::for_message`).
- **Switch**: `cl_sjkChatGifs` (archived, default 1; Settings > Network > SJK chat GIFs,
  under SJK chat sound, so in every settings screen and settings search). 0 keeps links
  as text and fetches nothing. With `cl_sjkChat 0` no message shows, so nothing is
  fetched either.
- **The chat's rules** let GIPHY links through: `:`, `/`, `.`, `-`, `_`, `?`, `=`, `&`
  and `%` are in the bio's punctuation, so `chat::check` and `chat::for_display` keep
  them unchanged (a test sends each shape through both). A message is at most 150
  characters, though: GIPHY's share links with all their tracking words
  (`/media/v1.<long token>/<id>/giphy.gif?cid=...&ep=...&rid=...&ct=g`) are often longer
  and are refused (`chat_length`); the page's link (`giphy.com/gifs/<slug>-<id>`) or the
  media link without its query fits.

## Who is online

The SJK chat page (not the docks, which stay small) has a small window at the top of its
right column, over the chosen message (Sol's request, 10/10/2026: "a small window on the
SJK chat, only when it is big, to quickly see who is online/active, and the most recent
active players that are offline"). It is drawn by
[sjk_chat_panel_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sjk_chat_panel_view.rs) from what
[sjk_chat_people.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sjk_chat_people.rs) derives.

Players show as faces, not names (Sol's request, 10/10/2026: "a little circle with their
profile picture in it, maybe just that actually, and the letter if no picture, with
mouse hover to see the profile card"): a disc with the player's hub picture, from the
picture cache the cards use ([avatars.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/avatars.rs)), or,
until it loads and for a player without one, the first letter of their name (colour
codes aside) on their own colour, as their card and profile draw it
(`profile_card::stand_in_colour`). Verified and staff marks are left to the card.

- **Online** (the heading carries the hub's count): the keys that read the feed in the
  last 60 seconds, the same keys `online` counts, so an SJK client with the chat on, in
  the menus or in a game, or one on a game server with the chat off. A gold dot at the
  foot of a face marks a player holding a live claim marked active (in a match,
  playing, as holocrons count it). Playing players come first, then by name (colours
  and symbols aside), each key once. Faces of 40 pixels at 1080p wrap nine to a row, two
  rows at most: with more than 18 players the last face says "+N" of the rest.
- **Recently active**: keys that read the feed before that, not online now, most
  recently seen first, up to eight smaller, dimmed faces in one row. No time is written
  on them: the card says it ("Seen 11 minutes ago", "Seen yesterday", as the servers'
  list words it); an online player's card says "Online now" or "Online now, in a match".
- Resting the pointer on a face shows the player's sender card with Mute or Unmute, as a
  name in the chat does, and rings the face in gold; the card opens left of the window,
  so the window's other faces do not show through it. A click chooses that player's
  newest message on show, if any. Muted players stay, their faces greyed. The player's
  own key is listed too.
- The window is as tall as what it shows, so Chosen message sits right under it.
- **A hub that does not list them** (the `people` below absent, as from the deployed hub
  today): the Online part keeps the count and says "This hub counts them but does not
  say who", and the second part becomes **Recently in chat**: the faces of the last
  eight senders, newest first, each once (holocron drops are not messages), their card
  saying when they last spoke. A message does not carry its sender's picture version,
  so the page asks, after the frame and outside the chat's lock, the profiles the
  client knows (the hub's players on the server, else a profile fetched once per key, as
  a sender card does) and keeps what it finds for 32 keys.
- Chat off, identity off or the hub not answered yet: the window says it shows once the
  hub answers.

The list rides on the feed the client already reads, so it needs no request of its own.
The client keeps the last list it was given (`ChatState::people`) until the hub gives
another, and forgets it when the chat is turned off or another hub is read.

### Proposed feed addition: `people`

Not in the hub yet; the client is built against it and falls back as above without it.

    "people":{"online":[Person],"recent":[Person]}
    Person: {"key_id":"..","name":"..","verified":false,"staff":false,"avatar":"<version>",
             "seen":<unix s>,"playing":false}

- Optional in a feed answer, so it stays `/v1/`. The hub adds it to a key's answer when
  it last gave that key the list 20 seconds ago or more (the first answer after `after`
  0 always has it), so the list costs one answer in a few and a reader's list is at most
  about 45 seconds old. It never wakes a waiting poll: it rides on the next answer.
- `online`: every key that read the feed in the last 60 seconds (as `online` counts),
  at most 50, `playing` set for a key holding a live claim with `active` true.
- `recent`: keys whose last feed read was more than 60 seconds and less than 7 days
  ago, most recent `seen` first, at most 8.
- `name`, `verified`, `staff` and `avatar` as in a Profile (the display name);
  `seen` is the key's last feed read. A key the operator removed is not listed.
- Nothing new is stored: the hub already keeps, in memory, when each key last read
  the feed for the count; it only needs to keep that past the minute (in memory, up to
  7 days, so a restart forgets it) and look up the profile fields.

## How a line looks

Every SJK chat line looks the same wherever it shows, in the game's chat, on the dock
and on the page ([sjk_chat_look.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sjk_chat_look.rs), Sol's
request, 08/10/2026):

- The message is drawn in the SJK chat's gold, `#F5C756` (`sjk_chat_look::GOLD`), a
  colour none of the game's codes give (`^0` to `^9`, in the game's palette or the SJK
  UI's lifted one; a test keeps it far from all of them), so it stands apart from
  every game chat line. The message's own colour codes are dropped
  (`sjk_chat_look::message_text`), so all of it is gold; the sender's name keeps its
  codes over the game's white.
- A verified sender has the verified tick after the name (the nameplates' gold seal
  with its white tick, `ui_renderer::VERIFIED_TEXTURE`) and no word: no "SJK VERIFIED"
  or "Verified" tag. Staff stays written on the page.
- The line flows as one line and wraps only when it is too long, as a game chat line
  does. In the game it used to break straight away: the feed drew a sender's name and
  its tag on a row of their own and the message under it (`NAME_ADVANCE` in
  `chat/view.rs`), while the servers' chat lines, which carry the name in their text,
  flowed. Now the first row holds the SJK tag, the name, the tick and a colon, and the
  message goes on after them (`Wrapped::update_indented` in `chat/layout.rs`, drawn by
  `chat/view/sjk_line.rs`); a first word too wide for what is left of that row starts
  the next. The page and the docks lay their lines out the same way, measured in their
  body family (`sjk_chat_look::flow`, `flow_each` for the docks, which lay out every
  frame without allocating). A message's own colour codes are dropped, so its wrapped
  rows need no colour carried over; the name, which keeps its codes, stays on the
  first row.

A holocron drop (`docs/holocrons.md`) is a line of its own kind in the same three
places: one sentence with no sender column, no colon and no tick, in its tier's colour
(`holocrons::TIERS`, none of the game's codes either), with a small gem where the tick
goes (`sjk_chat_look::gem_mark`): `Sol found a Legendary Holocron!`, and for the player's
own `You found an Uncommon Holocron.` The identity service's feed relays a drop as a
`ChatMessage` with an empty text and `holocron` set, in the feed's order; the game's chat,
the dock and the page word it from the tier (`holocrons::line`) and leave out a tier they
do not know. A muted player's drops are not shown.

## Muting a player

A player can be muted on this PC (Sol's request, 08/10/2026). It is local: nothing goes
to the hub or the game server, and the game is unchanged; only what this client shows
and plays changes.

- **Where:** rest the pointer on a name and the player's sender card shows beside it
  ([sender_card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sender_card.rs)), in the SJK UI's look
  wherever it is: in the game's chat while the composer is open (the pointer is free
  then), on an SJK chat sender's name or on the name of a player the server says sent
  the line ([chat/card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat/card.rs)); on the main page's
  dock; and on the SJK chat page. The card stays while the pointer moves onto it. It
  shows their picture (or their initial, as the profile card draws it,
  `profile_card::avatar`; the version comes from the hub's players on the server, else
  their profile, asked of the hub once, outside any lock:
  `player_identity::avatar_version`), the name and, for a verified player, the
  verified tick; whether the hub knows
  them (and staff); their hub name when it differs from the one shown; their key; their
  medals' medallions; where they are on the server being played ("On this server, slot
  5", or "slot 5, matched by name"); and Mute or Unmute. The Players page's card could
  not be reused: it is that page's right column, with score and ping. The page's
  chosen message keeps its Mute on this PC, which uses the same list.
- **What muting does:** their SJK chat lines are hidden (the page shows "Muted on this
  PC", the dock leaves them out, the game's feed hides them as ignored lines are) and so
  are their game chat lines once they are matched to a slot. While they are on the
  server, their model is drawn as `kyle/default` (Kyle's red or blue skin when a team
  game colours the teams, so the teams still show), each saber they hold or throw as
  `single_1` in the default blue (`color1` 4), with no hat or cape; a body they leave
  stays so. Their look ([unlockables.md](unlockables.md#receiving)) is not drawn
  either: no blade skin (so none of its sounds) and no lit Illuminate holocron
  (`Looks::set_muted`). Nothing whose source is their entity, or that the sound events name them as
  the cause of, is played: footsteps, jumps, pain, death, taunts and voice, weapon fire
  and charging, saber swings, hum, hits and blocks (`otherEntityNum2`), Force sounds,
  their voice commands, the hum and wall scrapes of their sabers, and the chat beep of
  their messages ([audio_mute.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/audio_mute.rs),
  `LegacySoundDecision::cause`). Their missiles' flight and impact sounds and the
  sounds of effect files stay: the protocol does not say whose they are. The test is a
  bit mask of slots, so it costs nothing while nobody is muted.
- **The list:** `chat-mutes.txt` beside `config.cfg`, one player a line: their SJK key
  (or `-` for a player the hub does not know) and the name they were last seen with
  ([chat_mutes.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/chat_mutes.rs),
  [player_mutes.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/player_mutes.rs)). It is read at start
  and written at every change, so mutes last across sessions (the page's mute used to
  last for the session only). At most 1024 players.
- **Matching a muted player to a slot**, as the scoreboard's badges do
  ([identity.md](identity.md#what-happens)): a slot whose claim at the hub was made
  under the name the game shows there is that key's. A slot no such claim covers is
  matched by name: the muted name and the shown one compared lower-cased, without
  colour codes and symbols (`sjk_identity::names_match`). That is weaker: anyone
  wearing the name is muted, and a muted player who renames is not; the card says
  "matched by name", and for a player the hub does not know, "By name, colours aside:
  anyone wearing it". A slot another key claims is never matched by name, and the
  player's own slot never is. A game chat line the server does not attribute (JA+
  servers) is hidden when it starts with the name shown in a muted slot, then `: `;
  such lines stay unclickable, as before. The muted slots are worked out only when the
  list, the hub's claims or the server's players change
  ([muted_players.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/muted_players.rs)), as a bit mask the
  renderer, the chat feed and the sound filter test.

## Emotes in the client (groundwork)

- `sjkemote <id>` sends an emote while on a server (named apart from the `emote`
  command some server mods have); `sjkemote` alone lists the catalogue.
- The catalogue is data: `emotes/<id>.emote` files in the game's file system (pk3s or
  the folder), each a JSON object: `name` (required, at most 32 characters), `torso`
  and `legs` animation names, `length_ms` (100 to 60000, required unless `loop` is
  true), `loop`, and `sound`. Unknown fields and bad values are refused with the file
  named in the log. None ship yet.
- A received emote counts only when the game shows, in its slot, the name its claim
  was made under (the badges' rule). It then plays in `emotes::ActiveEmotes`: per slot,
  the emote, when it started and when it ends (its length, 3 seconds for an id the
  catalogue lacks, never for a loop), and it ends early when the player moves 24 units
  or leaves. `emotes::active(slot)` is where the animations and sound plug in; until
  they exist, a received emote is written to the console (`* Sol: Wave`).

## Privacy

With `cl_identity`, `cl_hubUrl` and `cl_sjkChat` on, the hub sees the player's key
and IP address on every feed request (which it counts for `online`), and each message
or emote they send with the name they wear. With `cl_sjkChat` off it still sees the
feed requests made on a game server (for the looks), with the server's address. Messages are public to every SJK player,
kept in the hub's memory only (the last 200), and gone when the hub restarts; a
message staff delete stays in the staff log. Emotes are kept 10 seconds. The mute
flag is the only new thing on the hub's disk. Local mutes stay on this PC
(`chat-mutes.txt`, keys and names) and are never sent. With the proposed `people` list ([Who is online](#who-is-online)), every SJK
player reading the chat would see which keys read the feed in the last minute,
whether they are in a match (not which server), and when the others last read it, up
to a week back; the list is not deployed yet.

GIFs ([GIFs from GIPHY](#gifs-from-giphy)): with `cl_sjkChatGifs` on, a message linking
to a GIPHY GIF makes this PC fetch it from GIPHY (Giphy, Inc., a third-party service
with its own privacy policy), so GIPHY sees the player's IP address, the GIF's id and
when, as for any picture a browser loads from it. The hub is not involved and learns
nothing of it. Nothing else is sent: no cookie, key or name. GIFs stay in memory only.
`cl_sjkChatGifs 0` stops every request to GIPHY.

## Verification

08/10/2026, Ubuntu 24.04, Rust 1.99:

- Hub: unit tests for the rules and the feed (ids, the 200 kept, quotas, duplicates,
  batches of 50, a restart's `after`, emotes per server and their 10 seconds,
  deletions, the online count) and API tests run in memory, including the long poll
  under tokio's paused clock (answered when a message comes, empty after 25 seconds),
  emotes needing a claim, IPv6 servers, the feed's and the chat's own allowances (four
  readers behind one address, 40 reads a minute per key), staff delete and
  mute with the log, the operator's API and commands. `cargo test` and `cargo clippy
  --all-targets` pass.
- Client: unit tests for the rules (identical to the hub's), `for_display` and
  `name_for_display`, the feed
  thread against a scripted hub (order, repeats, 200 kept, deletions, a new hub, a
  restarted hub, turning the chat off, the 2 second gap, back-off), the worker
  (rules before sending, emotes needing a server, the feed only when registered with
  the chat on), the overlay's channel, the dock (fits under four servers and above the
  version at 1080p, 4K, 21:9, 4:3, 5:4, 1024x768; keys, typing, pointer), the page
  (every focus fits at 1080p, 4K, 4:3 and 21:9 in the families and Inter; keys,
  scrolling, mutes, staff only for staff), emotes (catalogue files, lengths, moving,
  trust), and the key's default and migration.
- End to end against a hub built and run on this PC (`hub_e2e`): a reader waiting at
  the hub received a message about 2 seconds after it was said, refusals came back
  with the hub's codes, an emote needed a claim and reached the server's reader, and
  the service's feed thread read its own message and stopped when the chat was turned
  off.
- The dock and the page were rendered off screen over a plain backdrop in the UI's
  families and looked at.
- Muting a player: unit tests for the list and its file, matching slots by claim and
  by name, the card on a name in the feed, the dock and the page, the hidden lines,
  Kyle and the default saber, and the sound filter ([status.md](status.md#muting-a-player-from-a-name-in-chat)).
  Not seen or heard in a game.

- The chat's sound (10/10/2026, Windows 11): unit tests for its making (0.74 seconds
  from a long talk sound, the quickened length and pitch, the highs kept, the fade
  reaching silence at 0.60 seconds, the echo taps on an impulse at 70 and 140 ms, the
  level and the clamp), for when it plays (only messages newer than the feed had seen,
  not the backlog, not the player's own, a muted player's or a drop, once a second) and
  the settings row. Made from the retail `talk.mp3` it matched the sound Sol chose,
  sample for sample: correlation 0.9993, RMS 0.03321 against 0.03319, the
  difference's RMS 0.0012, peak 0.527 against 0.527. Not heard in the client.

- GIFs (10/10/2026, Windows 11): unit tests for the links (every shape, bad ids,
  look-alike hosts such as `giphy.com.evil.example`, a user or port, `http` fetched over
  `https`), the address rebuilt and checked, the small rendition first and the original
  only after a 404, the 4 MiB cap, decoding (frames, delays, the 20 to 100 ms clamp,
  scaling to 480, 240 frames and the byte budget falling back to the first frame), the
  cache (asked once, uploaded once per frame change, a failure not asked again at once,
  eviction by count and by bytes, slots for GIFs on screen), muted senders and the switch
  fetching nothing, the settings row, and the page and the docks fitting their GIF at
  1080p and 4K. One real GIF fetched from GIPHY by an ignored test
  (`chat_gifs::fetch::tests::a_real_gif_from_giphy`): `200.gif` of `3o7TKSjRrfIPjeiVyM`,
  582,333 bytes in about 0.26 s, 200 by 200, 43 frames, 3.5 s long; a made-up id gave
  404. World shots over duel6 with test GIFs made in the test
  (`world_shot::chat_gifs_shots`, the page and both docks at 1080p and 4K) were looked
  at. Not seen in the game window or with a GIF sent through the hub.

Not verified: no client was started, so nothing was seen in a game or over the map;
nothing went through Cloudflare's tunnel or the deployed hub (which does not have the
routes yet); Windows; how the feed behaves with many players at once.
