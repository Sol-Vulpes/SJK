# SJK UI

The SJK UI (`ui_menuStyle sjk`) is SJK's own menu style: SJK's menus redesigned
from the ground up, drawn over the live map in SJK's own type. It keeps the
feeling of Jedi Academy's menus (gold for what you choose, holo blue line-work,
the turning ring round the emblem) and drops their window frames and boxes. It
is SJK's default menu style since 08/10/2026 (Sol's call, before every screen
had its version); [classic+](classic-plus.md) stays a choice and keeps getting
fixes. A profile saved with the old default `classic` moves to `sjk` once
([client.md](client.md#menu-style)).

Status (08/10/2026): the main page, Settings (with the key bindings),
Character, What's new, Update, Identity, Credits, Servers (the server browser),
the loading screen, the scoreboard, the in-game menu (reworked 09/10/2026), the
Profile screen, the Collection (10/10/2026), Camera control, the report and note
dialog (Report a bug) and the new medal pop-up are done. Every other
screen opens in its classic+ version, which
covers the map as the classic style does.
The other style: First setup's Menu style row, Settings > Interface > Menu style, or
`ui_menuStyle classic`; restart for the style's map behind the main page.

## Design

Sol chose the direction on 07/10/2026 from three mock-ups (a design canvas of
the main page in three directions, a Settings screen and the kit). The main page
is direction A, the ring: the emblem in a turning ring and the menu on an arc
round it, with the servers the player joined last in a column on its right, over
direction C's map (mp/duel6). (A first build combined A's ring with C's horizon
line and B's servers under Play; Sol went back to A the same day.)

Principles:

1. **Content floats on the world.** No boxes or window frames: structure comes
   from alignment, thin lines and dark fades at the screen's edges, over the
   live map.
2. **One memorable thing per screen.** On the main page, the ring and its gold
   arc, which turns to point at the chosen entry. Everything else stays quiet.
3. **Gold is the choice.** Gold marks what is chosen and the one main action of a
   screen; ember is only for leaving. Holo blue draws lines, never text that
   matters.
4. **Words, not capitals.** Navigation and labels are in sentence case.
5. **Keyboard first, pointer equal.** Every screen works with the arrows, Enter
   and Escape alone; hovering chooses, a click acts.
6. **One brand.** The colours and type are SJK's site's
   (`site/assets/style.css`), so the site, the release notes and the client
   read as one thing.

### Colours

Display values, like all 2D colours ([rendering.md](rendering.md)), in
`menu::sjk::color`:

| Token | Value | Use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Space | `#060A14` | The ground and the fades; never pure black |
| Holo | `#A8CFFF` | Line-work: rules, ticks, outlines, the ring |
| Gold | `#E8B84A` | What is chosen; the screen's one main action |
| Gold bright | `#FFD97A` | Chosen text and marks |
| Text | `#E2E9F6` | Text |
| Muted | `#A9B5CB` | Secondary text |
| Quiet | `#8792AC` | An item that ends the session |
| Ember | `#FF7A3D` | Leaving: Quit |

### Type

Two bundled vector families, as on SJK's site, both under the SIL Open Font
License (licences beside the fonts in `crates/sjk-viewer/assets/fonts`):

- **Rajdhani** (SemiBold, Bold), the display family: navigation, titles, key caps,
  numbers. It lacks a few symbols (superscripts, fractions, ordinals, ¤, µ),
  which come from Exo 2 SemiBold.
- **Exo 2** (Regular, SemiBold), the body family: details, descriptions,
  everything else. Its static weights are instances of the variable font
  (`fonttools varLib.instancer`), since the rasterizer reads only a variable
  font's default instance.

Sizes are in pixels of a 1080-line screen and scale with the window's height:
the main page's entries 44 (chosen 68), server names 27, the player's name 26,
details 16 to 18, key hints 15 to 17; on Settings, its name 48, the categories
26, sub-headings 22, row names and descriptions 19, the detail's title 32 and
its facts 17.

Names keep their colour codes (`^1`...), drawn in a palette lifted to read on
the navy ground (`text::CodePalette::Legible`, which every text in the UI's
families uses): black shows as grey, and red, green, blue and magenta are
lighter with the same hue; the other colours are the game's.

`ui_gameFont` (classic game fonts) does not change the SJK UI's type; it keeps
applying to the classic screens and the in-game text.

Text is centred on its rectangle's middle line (`menu::sjk::text`): the
renderer sets a run's line box from the rectangle's top, so the helper places
it from each family's measured metrics, the middle of the capitals leaning a
quarter toward the lower case (0.489 of the size down the line box for
Rajdhani, 0.563 for Exo 2; a test checks them against the bundled fonts).
Every SJK UI text goes through it, so a control's text rectangle is simply the
control's own.

### Motion

The ring turns once every four minutes and the sunburst behind the emblem
slowly the other way; the gold arc eases towards the chosen entry (about 0.3 s);
the camera behind glides through its tour (The map behind); on the loading
screen a gold arc turns once every three seconds and the destination's
levelshot fades in (0.45 s); on Credits the sun (its sunburst, god rays and
sparks) keeps turning and rising, and the page's rows rise into place as it
opens or a fold unfolds; on the Collection's Shaders an owned blade skin's swatch
lives (its corona breathes, flame loops rise and a flare runs along it, as its file
says) and the model on the stage holds the chosen blade;
a new medal arrives in its ceremony and, the screen's one memorable thing, breathes
gently while it waits ([New medal](#new-medal)). Nothing else moves on its own.

## The map behind

Behind the SJK UI the camera tours mp/duel6: ten authored shots
(`YAVIN_TRAINING_TOUR` in
[routes.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu_backdrop/routes.rs), keyed by the map's
worldspawn message "Yavin Training Grounds"), each a 15-second glide from one
point to another while looking at a third, with a 0.9-second fade through the
UI's navy between them ([tour.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu_backdrop/tour.rs)).
The tour opens on the map's own intermission view (the west wing's room looking
down the corridor at the tower), then plays the rest in a shuffled order that
changes every start and every round, never showing the same shot twice in a
row. The shots: the tower from three gardens, high; the east and south wings'
rooms; the tower from its foot; over the courtyard's wall at its base; the
south temple's stair; a diagonal path from the tower. They were placed with the
off-screen world shots and checked to glide through open air (the north wing's
view, full of leaves, and the west garden's, half a wall, were dropped).

On a map with a tour, a screen whose shot has a route is reached by fading out,
cutting to the shot and fading in, instead of flying there, since a tour's
shots are all over the map; every screen shows at once. The fade is a layer
over the world only (`ClientMenu::world_fade`), under the menus and the
console's pages. duel6 has two such shots, both on the south-west path from the
tower, between its stone benches, where the player's model stands
(`YAVIN_TRAINING_PLAYER`, floor at z 352, facing the camera): the player shot,
80 units off and turned so the model stands right of the screen's middle with
the tower behind; and the saber shot (`YAVIN_TRAINING_SABER`), a step closer,
the thrown saber floating between the camera and the model.

## Main page

[home.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/home.rs), drawn over the live map,
which is mp/duel6 when the client starts in the SJK UI
(`MenuStyle::boot_map`). It is laid out on a 16:9 frame of 1080-line pixels
centred in the window: a wider window shows more map at its sides, a narrower
one (4:3, 5:4) scales the frame down to its width.

- **Ring:** SJK's emblem (380 across) in a ring of tick marks, 312 in radius,
  centred at (620, 540). The ring is a light picture drawn by the emblem worker
  (`EmblemLayer::Ring`), tinted holo; a gold arc (24 degrees) on it points at the
  chosen entry, a dotted gold beam reaching towards it, and turns to the servers
  while they have the keyboard.
- **Arc:** the page's entries on an arc of radius 440 round the ring's right
  side, 16 degrees apart (12.5 for six, so the ends keep clear of the ring); the
  chosen one gold and larger, with a line saying what it opens. The pages:
  - Main: Play, Profile (the [Profile screen](#profile-screen) on its Character
    tab; it read Character until 09/10/2026), Collection (the
    [Collection](#collection), since 10/10/2026), Settings (the settings screen),
    SJK, Quit.
  - Play: Join a server (the browser), Create a game, Back.
  - SJK: What's new (the changelog), Update, Credits, Back (the Profile screen is
    the main page's Profile, and its profile card). The arc holds six entries (a
    seventh curls back into the ring); the identity's key is in Settings, Network.
  - Quit: Quit to desktop (ember when chosen), Stay. It opens on Stay.
  A page's name stands small over its first entry.
- **Recent servers:** a column on the right (its rule at x 1470) of the servers
  the player joined last, newest first, up to four, kept in
  `recent_servers.json` beside `favorites.json` ([recent.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/recent.rs)):
  a server is recorded when a join reaches the game, with its name and map,
  except a game this client hosts. Each shows its name (live from the server
  list, or as last seen), its players, map and ping while the server list has
  it, and when it was last played ("2 hours ago", "yesterday": relative, so no
  time zone is needed). Before any join, the column offers the JoF server
  (`135.125.145.49:29070`) under "Start here".
- **SJK chat:** docked under the servers (from y 700, [hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md)):
  "SJK chat" and the online count, the last messages sitting on a field in a box five
  one-row messages high, newest at the bottom (each the name, the verified tick for a
  verified sender and the text in the SJK chat's gold, wrapped onto as many rows as it
  needs since 10/10/2026, Sol's request: a long message pushes older ones out), the
  field, and Open chat in gold under
  it, which opens the SJK chat page. The same dock, drawn by the same code
  ([chat_dock.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/chat_dock.rs)), sits in the
  [in-game menu](#in-game-menu). Resting the pointer on a name shows the sender's
  [sender card](#sjks-pages) beside it, with Mute
  ([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md#muting-a-player)). It keeps clear of the profile card
  bottom left in every window (`the_sender_card_keeps_clear_of_the_profile_card`); its
  targets are the page's own (60 to 64 the names, 70 the card, 71 Mute).
  Down past the last server reaches the field
  (the gold arc turns to it); Enter types and every key goes to the field until Enter
  sends or Escape stops. Not shown with `cl_sjkChat 0`.
- **Corners:** the player's [profile card](#profile-card), bottom left; the keys
  of the page, bottom centre; the version and a newer release found, bottom right.

Keys: Up and Down move along the arc; Enter takes the entry; Right (or Tab)
moves to the servers, Up and Down choose one, Enter joins it, Left or Escape
returns to the arc. Left from the arc chooses the profile card (the gold arc turns
to it), Enter opens the Profile screen on its SJK Profile tab, and Right, Up, Tab or
Escape return to the arc. Escape on a page returns to the main page, on the entry that
opened it; on the main page it opens Quit's page. The pointer chooses by
hovering and acts with a click. A server with a password opens the browser's
password prompt.

### Profile card

[profile_card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/profile_card.rs) (08/10/2026, Sol's
request: the name and circle in the corner show the SJK profile, with a picture, and
open it). Bottom left on the 16:9 frame, from (84, 932), 474 by 96:

- the player's picture, a disc 72 across at (96, 944): their picture once it is
  loaded, else the first letter of their name (past colour codes and symbols) on a
  colour picked from their key; ringed holo, gold when verified, bright gold when the
  card is chosen, with the verified badge at its foot for a verified key
  ([identity.md](identity.md#pictures));
- their name with its colours (Exo 2 at 27);
- a line of what the SJK hub says: "Verified" (gold) or "SJK player", the medals
  given ("2 medals", left out with none) and the achievements unlocked ("12/21
  achievements"); without the hub it says "SJK identity off", "Connecting to the hub"
  or "SJK hub out of reach", still with this PC's achievements;
- their model and blade ("Kyle, blue saber", or "Kyle, Sun blade" while they wear a
  blade skin their profile holds, [unlockables.md](unlockables.md)); when the card is
  chosen, "Open your profile: picture, bio and record" in gold instead.

The pointer chooses it by hovering (a dark band with a gold edge round it) and a click
opens the Profile screen on its SJK Profile tab. What it says is gathered twice a second from the settings,
the identity service and the achievement counts (`profile_card::refresh`); a frame
reads it in place. The same card stands bottom left in the in-game menu.

## Character

[player_menu/sjk_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/player_menu/sjk_view.rs): the
player screen, the [Profile screen](#profile-screen)'s Character, Saber and Force
tabs, opened by the main page's Profile and the in-game menu's Profile. The model
stands on duel6's
stage in the map's own light, holding the saber draft lit, and every change
shows on it at once (`menu_stage`). The screen is laid out
on the 16:9 frame, dark behind the form on the left and clear over the model.

- **Top:** the way back (Esc, "Main menu") and the player's name, with its
  colours, as the title; under it the pages as tabs, Character, Saber and
  Force, the one on show gold and underlined. As the Profile screen (the SJK UI
  always opens it so) the row holds the screen's four tabs instead
  ([Profile screen](#profile-screen)).
- **Character:** Name (a field; Enter types), Team colour, Search (a field that
  filters the grid), Model (‹ › steps through the grid), the model grid (eight
  icons a row, as many rows as fit, the current one ringed gold, scrolled by
  the wheel), then a species' head, torso, legs and skin colour and the hat and
  cape, two to a line.
- **Saber:** Style as three buttons (Single, Staff, Dual); the hilts as a list
  under a sub-heading (Hilt, or Staff), in two columns, six lines on show,
  scrolled by the wheel or its bar, the chosen one gold with a dot and kept in
  view (in the middle when the list first shows); for Dual two lists side by
  side, Right hand and Left hand, four lines each. The hilts come in the game's
  load order, as JoF EJK lists them (`legacy_saber_load_order`). The hilt search
  (10/10/2026, Sol's request) is a field at the right of the lists' heading line
  (beside Left hand for Dual), drawn as the Character page's Search ("Search
  hilts", then the words typed and "N found"): Enter or a click types in it, and
  the lists show only the hilts whose name or file name holds every word typed,
  ignoring case ("No hilt matches" when none does); one search filters both of
  Dual's lists, and Left and Right on a list step through its matches. Escape
  while typing clears it, as on Character; a search kept with Enter clears with
  Escape, and the next Escape leaves. Under the lists the Blade row (10/10/2026,
  Sol's request): the stock blade in the first blade's colour, then every blade
  skin the player's hub profile lists, each the Collection's swatch shrunk to 79
  by 44 (moving as there; [unlockables.md](unlockables.md#saber-tabs-blade-choice)),
  the one worn ringed gold, and under the row's name the name of the one under
  the pointer or worn; six show at a time (10/10/2026), scrolled so the worn one
  stands third where it can, with a gold chevron at a side that has more; with no skin owned, or the identity off, only the stock
  blade and a line saying why. Then the blade's colour as seven chips (the six
  stock colours and the custom one, ringed gold when chosen), its red, green
  and blue sliders (a digit types the number), and the second blade's for Dual.
  The camera cuts to the saber shot, where the model throws the saber to float
  and turn before it. World shot: `world_shot::saber_skins::duel6_sjk_saber_page`
  (the search typed, a search finding nothing with no skin owned, Dual; at 1080p,
  with `ui_textScale` 1.2, and at 4K with it).
- **Force:** the mastery ("Jedi Master") and the points left of the rank's
  ("18 of 100 points left", and "not applied yet" while the draft differs)
  over a gold bar of the points left; the Light and Dark sides as two cards
  with their emblems; the powers in classic+'s groups under sub-headings,
  Neutral and Lightsaber down the left, the side's five on the right (the
  other side's left out, as on classic+): each its holocron, its name and its
  three levels as classic+ draws them (retail's `forcecircle` and `forcestar`,
  drawn by the UI): round marks numbered with what each level costs (0 when
  free), a ring until bought, a disc once bought, on a channel lit up to the
  power's level. Each group has its colour, its sub-heading's too: Neutral
  silver, the light side blue, the dark side red, Lightsaber green
  (`power_tint`). The bought discs glow. Hovering a level beyond the power's
  charges the channel up to it, a white spark running along it, the marks it
  would buy breathing; the points it would take show white at the bar's end
  (ember, marks and bar, when there are too few). A click on a level buys up to
  it, a right click on a level removes it (the power stands one below it); a
  level bought (by click or Right) sends a ring out from its mark. These are the only things that move on the
  page, and only answering the pointer or a purchase. Then Apply (gold while there
  is something to apply) across the left column under the Lightsaber group, with
  Start over and Discard side by side below it, clear of This server's lines. On a server, a power it
  turns off, holds at a level or does not use keeps its marks and has an ember
  note under its name (Off on this server, Fixed on this server, Team games
  only), and under the side's five, This server lists its rules: the highest
  rank and its points, free saber skills, the powers it turns off (past eight,
  how many), whether team powers work, and that turned-off powers stay
  pickable for full Force duels and an applied profile counts from the next
  respawn ([client.md](client.md#force-profile-on-a-server)).
- **Power box:** on the Force page, bottom right, the power under the pointer
  (or the keyboard) in big: its holocron, name, group, level, what it does in a
  line or two, what the server does with it when it limits it, the next
  level's price (or Mastered, Needs Saber offense 1...) and its levels'
  prices.
- **Caption:** beside the model, bottom right under a short gold rule, what the
  page shows of it: the model and its skin, the saber's style, hilt and blade,
  or (on the Force page with no power chosen) the side and rank.
- **Keys:** bottom right, the focused row's (Left Right change, Enter type or
  do it) and Tab with the next page's name.

The keys are the player screen's shared ones: Up and Down choose a row (on the Saber and
Force pages in the order they show them: the hilt search, both hilt lists, the
Blade row and the blades' colours,
the Force groups' powers in their order, the other side's skipped), Left and
Right change it (a hilt list's choice moves one hilt, the Blade row's one
blade), Enter types or acts, Tab
and `[` `]` change page (on the Profile screen, its tabs: from Force on to SJK
Profile), Escape returns to the main page (dropping an
unapplied Force draft, as before). The pointer: a click on a control acts (‹ ›
by the half of the control it lands on, a chip picks the colour drawn under
it, a slider follows, a style button, a hilt, a blade, a level, the search
field types), a click elsewhere on a
row (a Force power's holocron or name too) only chooses it, a click on a tile
picks that model. The SJK view's own targets (levels, the Blade row's
blades, style buttons, hilts and the lists' wheel areas, tokens from 1000) go to
`PlayerMenu::sjk_pointer` before the screen's shared pointer handling.

It is the player screen's shared state and controller with a view of its own:
the rows, tiles, tabs and back key answer to the screen's tokens, each row
registering its control before the whole row so the token's rectangle is the
control's.

Opened from a game (the in-game menu's Profile), where the menu map's stage
is not, the same screen shows with "Game menu" as its way back, over the match
dimmed by half, and the model stands right of the form in a live preview of its
own (`menu_stage::preview`, the classic pages' preview, asked for by
`PlayerMenu::sjk_model_preview` in the frame's `MODEL_AREA`): holding the saber
draft lit in its style's stance, held still at a three-quarter angle (28 degrees
to its right) rather than turning as retail's did, framed with 1.35 times
retail's room so a raised blade stays in the picture, on a soft shadow and a
thin gold line at its feet. `ClientMenu::stage_model` never stages a screen
opened from a game.

## SJK's pages

What's new, Update, Identity, Profile and Credits, which the main page's SJK page opens
(and their console commands; Profile as the [Profile screen](#profile-screen)'s
tab, the Collection as its own screen, Identity from Settings, Network, Credits and
What's new also from the in-game menu's row of icons), and the Staff, Collection and
SJK chat pages have the
SJK UI's look in this style (Profile, Staff, Collection and SJK chat in every style): drawn in its
families over the map darkened as Settings is (Update as a pop-up card, as First
setup), each with the way back (Esc, "Back") and its name at the top and its
keys bottom right. They stay the
console's pages (their state, keys, pointer and opening and closing are as in
the other looks); `ViewerConsole::set_sjk_pages` picks the look and the console
overlay routes their text to the UI's families (`console_sjk_pages.rs`).

- **What's new** ([changelog_sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/changelog_sjk.rs)):
  the releases down a lit rail on the left, newest first (name, then date or
  "Not released yet" in gold), the chosen one gold; beside them a reading
  column with its date and number of changes, its name, its introduction, then
  each change after a gold dot with its credit under it, scrolled by Page Up
  and Down or the wheel. Lines are wrapped by characters.
- **Update** ([update_panel_sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/update_panel_sjk.rs)):
  a pop-up card (840 wide, as tall as what it says) over the map darkened all
  over, since 08/10/2026 (Sol asked for it with First setup's). Update (gold)
  and the version this is along its top, what the check found as a headline
  over its detail, the download's progress as a gold bar with its percentage,
  then the actions along its foot: Release notes and Check again on the left
  when offered, Close and the one Enter takes (gold: Install, Restart now,
  Check, Open release page) on the right.
- **Identity** ([identity_panel_sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/identity_panel_sjk.rs)):
  the identity's state as a headline (the name the hub knows, or "Identity is
  off") over its lines, the switch sharing it with the hub, then while it is on
  the bio's field and Save (gold), Copy my key id, Show key (Hide key once shown)
  and Use the official hub, and the known players here under a sub-heading,
  verified ones marked gold. The key's id and file are bullets with "(hidden)" until
  Show key, every time the page opens ([identity.md](identity.md#settings-and-commands)). A Medals
  column right of the page's lists the player's own medals once the hub answered
  (picture, name in gold, description, date given, the team's note), or says how
  medals come ([identity.md](identity.md#medals)).
- **Profile** ([profile_panel_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/profile_panel_view.rs),
  08/10/2026, Sol's request: a real profile with the medals and an editable bio):
  drawn in this look in every menu style. On its own (the `profile` command with the
  classic menus) the top bar says Profile; in the SJK UI it is the Profile screen's
  SJK Profile tab, under the screen's title and row of tabs, moved down 44 pixels
  (`profile_panel::Mode`). Three columns: who the player is (their picture, a disc 104
  across with "Add a picture" or "Change picture" under it, beside the hub name in its
  colours at 38, verified, member since, other names; then Staff tools for a staff
  key) over "Your record" (eight numbers in two columns) and "Unlocked lately"; "About
  you", the bio's box (620 by 300, Exo 2 at 18, wrapped by measured width, the end
  being written kept in view) with its counts, Revert and Save (gold) and the rules;
  Medals (pictures at 84, on its own only), Achievements (how many unlocked, a gold
  bar, See the board) and Collection (how many shaders owned at 30, or a line saying
  they are kept on the hub, and See the collection; Tab reaches it after See the
  board). See the board opens the [Collection](#collection) on Achievements, See the
  collection on Medals (as the Collection screen in the SJK UI, on its own in the
  classic menus). Until 10/10/2026 the page also held the achievements board and the
  medals as tabs. World shot: `world_shot::tests::duel6_sjk_profile`. The picture (a
  click, or Enter on it after Tab) opens the picture panel in the bio's place
  (08/10/2026): "Your picture", the picture 220 across (the one about to be sent,
  ringed bright gold, else the player's), beside it a headline (No picture yet,
  Reading the picture..., Your new picture, Sending..., Taking it down...), the file's
  name and the last message (gold, ember when something went wrong, the reason a
  picture was refused), under it Browse... (Choosing... while the system's file
  dialog is open) beside "Choose a picture file on this PC, or drop one on this
  window", what a picture may be and that everyone sees it, then Use this picture
  (gold), Remove picture (Press again while it waits) and Done. Escape returns to the
  bio first ([identity.md](identity.md#pictures)).
- **Staff** ([staff_panel_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/staff_panel_view.rs),
  08/10/2026, for staff keys, [identity.md](identity.md#staff)): the top bar's
  search pill finds players; Me and Seen lately over the list of players found (14
  rows of 50, the chosen one banded, tags Staff and Verified in gold); the chosen
  player's picture (a disc 64 across), name at 38 and facts over the middle and
  right, and Take picture down at the right (dimmed without one); Medals: each medal's
  medallion (dim when not held), name and count, date given, Give (gold) and Take
  back, then the note's field (sent with the next medal or unlock); Unlockables under
  it: each unlockable of the catalogue, two to a row of 36 (all fourteen fit, since
  10/10/2026), its name at 16 (gold when held), "Since" its date or "Not held", and one
  button, Unlock (gold) when not held or Relock when held, as the medals' Give and
  Take back; Achievements: Clear all (Press again while it waits),
  each achievement with a count, its date or count and Clear, and a line on what
  clearing does. The last request's answer bottom left (gold, ember when refused).
  World shot: `world_shot::tests::duel6_sjk_staff` (the player's own, then another
  holding the Sun blade).
- **Collection**: its own screen since 10/10/2026, drawn in this look in every menu
  style ([Collection](#collection)); it replaces the Unlockables page.
- **SJK chat** ([sjk_chat_panel_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sjk_chat_panel_view.rs),
  08/10/2026, Sol's request, [hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md)): drawn in this look in every
  menu style. The online count in gold over a line on what the chat is; the messages
  down the left, newest at the bottom over the field and Send (gold), each one flowing
  line ([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md#how-a-line-looks)): its name in its colours, the
  verified tick for a verified sender, and its text in the SJK chat's gold going on
  after them and wrapping when too long, with Staff and how long ago on the right of
  its first row; a chosen one is banded and shown on the right with Mute on this PC and, for
  staff, Delete for everyone, Mute and Unmute at the hub. "N older: Page Up" and "N
  newer: Page Down" mark the ends when it scrolls. Resting the pointer on a name shows
  the sender's sender card over the page, beside the name, with Mute or Unmute
  ([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md#muting-a-player)).
- **Sender card** ([sender_card.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sender_card.rs),
  08/10/2026, Sol's request): a name under the pointer in the game's chat (composer
  open), on the main page's dock and on the SJK chat page. A 340-wide navy card with a
  holo edge: their picture in a 48-wide disc (the [profile card](#profile-card)'s, their
  initial on their colour until it loads or when they have none), the name and the
  verified tick alone, "SJK player" (gold, with "SJK staff")
  or "Not known to the SJK hub", the hub name when it differs, the key, where they are
  on the server being played, their medals' medallions, Mute or Unmute (gold edged) and
  what that does. It sits right of the name, or left of it at the screen's edge.
- **Credits** ([credits_sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/credits_sjk.rs), since
  08/10/2026, Sol's request: restyle Credits but keep its sun): on the left SJK's
  emblem (220 across, centred at (300, 330)) is the page's sun, the one memorable
  thing: the classic page's two sunbursts turn opposite ways behind it, its
  golden god rays (`EmblemLayer::Godrays`, two sets against each other) reach out
  from it across the page and sparks rise through their light on the left; the
  reading column has a navy shade of its own (half), so the rays cross it softly.
  Under the emblem "The people who make SJK", then the sections down a lit
  rail, the one in view gold (a click scrolls to it), and Expand all (Collapse
  all once a fold is open). The column (x 640, 1120 wide, from y 140 to 960,
  scrolled by the arrows, Page Up and Down, Space, Home and End, the wheel and a
  thin holo scrollbar at x 1800) holds each section under a sub-heading:
  - Someone with a history: the name (Rajdhani 84 for Sol JK's section, 62 for
    the rest), the GitHub handle in gold at the right of its line, the role, the
    counts (changes when some are not pull requests, pull requests, commits) as
    gold numbers with their words, the links in gold after a holo dot, and the
    card's medals in a column on the right (the whole medal on its ribbon, 104
    across, its name in gold and what it is for). Then the folds as rows of 50,
    a plus (a gold minus when open) before Highlights or All work (All pull
    requests when all of it is), their count on the right, the band under the
    pointer. All work runs down a holo thread, each day a dot and its date over a
    rule; a row is the title, its pull request as a gold outlined tag (which
    opens it) and its commits; a row of several has a plus that unfolds them
    (hash in gold, subject, who made it when not the owner), a row of one a gold
    dot and its hash (it opens the commit).
  - Everyone else (Claude, the fonts, the references): cards two across the
    column, each under a thin holo rule: name, handle, role, medals (medallion
    and name), lines after gold dots, links.
  - Then the trademark notice.
  Keys bottom right: Up Down scroll, Tab section (Shift+Tab, `[` and `]` too), E
  expand all, Esc back. The layout is in frame pixels measured in the families
  (with the player's text style), so it holds at every window size and is laid
  out again only when a fold, the fonts or the style change. Pointer areas go to
  the rows the column shows whole, within the canvas's 96 (a test sweeps every
  scroll, folded and fully unfolded, at 1080p, 4K, 4:3 and 21:9). Pictures and
  arcs are kept out of the column's edges: the renderer clips a picture by
  squeezing it and leaves arcs whole, so the fold marks are rectangles and a
  medal's picture shows only while the column shows it whole.

## Console

With the SJK UI's menus the console (`con_style auto`) is the SJK UI's deck;
`con_style sjk` chooses it whatever the menus
([client.md](client.md#sjk-ui-console)). It is the classic console's grid and
keys in this style's colours, its gold `›` and caret, labels in its families
and key caps, on the console's own layer. The command browser (F3) is drawn in
this style with it, laid out as Settings (filters down a lit rail, entries, the
chosen entry's detail column), and its detail's text can be selected with the
mouse and copied
([client.md](client.md#useful-console-commands)). Two other designs, a
horizon (no panel edge, the navy fading out under a gold line) and a dock (an
outlined card with tabs), were offered beside it; Sol chose the deck
(08/10/2026), which reads best over a bright map and keeps the classic
console's full-width rows, and the other two were removed.

## Settings

[sjk_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/settings/sjk_view.rs) draws it, and
[settings.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/settings.rs) lists its
categories and opens, switches and closes it. The main page's Settings opens it
on the category last shown (Display the first time in a run); First setup at
start and the `firstsetup` command open First setup as a pop-up
([First setup](#first-setup)). It is laid out on the main page's 16:9 frame,
over the map darkened from the left (95 %) to the right (80 %), as the Settings
mock-up draws it.

- **Top:** the way back (an Esc key cap, "Main menu", also a click target) and
  the screen's name, top left; the search pill, top right ("Find a setting", its
  `/` key, then the number found).
- **Rail:** the categories down a lit holo line on the left, each with its
  settings icon: First setup, Display, Graphics, Sound, Mouse, Key bindings,
  Gameplay, Interface, HUD, Quick wheel, Scoreboard, Network. The one on show is
  gold with a gold bar on the line; none is lit while a search shows its results.
  Network's SJK identity key row (09/10/2026, Sol's request: the key out of the
  Profile screen and hidden, for streaming) reads "Hidden: open to see" and Enter
  opens the Identity page over Settings ([SJK's pages](#sjks-pages)), which shows
  Settings again when it closes.
  Quick wheel wears the wheel's own icon, a ring of discs from its second board
  (`quick_wheel::catalog::WHEEL_ICON`; `settings_icons::texture` falls back to
  the wheel's icons), since 08/10/2026.
  - They are the classic+ Setup page's groups (`settings::Group` and tabs), but
    Graphics gathers the renderer's four tabs (image, lighting, shadows, weather)
    under their names (`Group::Graphics`).
  - Key bindings shows every action under its group's sub-heading (Movement,
    Interaction, Weapons, Force powers, Other), its picture before its name
    where it has one, its two keys as caps on the right (a dash for an empty
    one); the cap awaiting a key turns gold ("Press a key") and the detail
    column says what to press. The detail column names its keys, default key,
    console command and what else its keys do. The search finds actions by
    name, command, key or group. Enter, or a click on the row or its first cap,
    awaits its first key; a click on its second cap, its second; Backspace
    clears its keys; Escape cancels the wait. It is the classic+ list of the
    key-binding editor (`keybind_editor/sjk_view.rs`).
- **Rows:** the open category's rows in a column (x 470 to 1270), 56 tall, under
  sub-headings (holo, with a rule after them): the name on the left, the control
  ending at 1226 and the reset arrow after it. Fourteen lines show; a longer
  category scrolls (wheel, scrollbar), keeping the focused row in view.
  - Controls, from the kit: a switch (gold with its knob right when on, On or
    Off after it); a slider (a gold-filled track and its number, which a click
    or a typed digit opens for typing); segments for a choice of up to three; a
    field with a caret for a longer list, the display mode, the resolution and
    the HUD (the last two open their full-screen pickers); a field for text.
  - The focused row has a soft band and a gold bar at its left; a row changed
    from its default a gold dot after its name, and when focused the reset arrow.
    The dot is placed from the name's width as the body font draws it (the
    player's `ui_textScale` and `ui_letterSpacing` included), 8 pixels after
    its last letter; a name cut short at its column has it at the column's end.
    Key bindings' rows place theirs the same way.
  - A list opens under its field (over it near the bottom), its choice in use
    marked with a gold dot; the controls under it are left out while it is open.
- **Detail:** on the right (x 1360, 464 wide), the focused setting: its
  category's icon (a search result's own group's) and its name, what it does,
  then its default, range or choices, when a change applies (gold), where a
  search found it and its console name (holo). First setup adds how to import
  another client's .cfg.
- **Keys:** bottom right, the keys of what has the keyboard: the focused row's
  (Enter switch, Left Right change, Enter choices...), Backspace for the default
  when it changed, Tab for the next category; a list's, a search's or a typed
  value's own while they are open.

Keys: Up and Down choose a row (Up from the first, or `/`, goes to the search);
Left and Right change it; Enter switches, opens a list or starts typing;
Backspace returns it to its default; Tab and `]` (`[` back) open the next
category, past Key bindings; Escape closes a list, clears a search, then returns
to the main page. Hovering a row chooses it; a click on a control acts, a click
on a row's name only chooses it (a switch flips from anywhere on its row); the
right button returns a row to its default.

The rows are a classic+ panel's (`settings::ClassicRows`), so the search over
every setting, the lists, the defaults and typed numbers are the classic+
panels' own; only the drawing and the frame are the SJK UI's. Changing Menu
style on the screen (it is on Interface) hands over to the classic+ panel of the
same group (Graphics: the renderer's image tab).

### First setup

At start (until it is ticked off) and from the `firstsetup` command, First setup
is a pop-up card over the map, not the Settings screen (Sol's request,
08/10/2026, with the tick that stops it opening always in view at its foot). [sjk_popup.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/settings/sjk_popup.rs)
draws it; the rail's First setup category still shows the same rows in the
Settings screen.

- **Card:** 960 wide and 948 tall, centred, over the map darkened all over
  (78 %), with the browser prompts' glass, shadow and holo edge (`kit::card`).
- **Top:** "First setup", what it is for, and how to bring another client's
  .cfg over.
- **Rows:** First setup's rows as Settings draws them, its column moved into
  the card, under its sub-headings (Graphics first, the [graphics
  quality](client.md#graphics-quality) level, whose list opens on Enter; then
  Styles: menu and camera style).
  Eleven lines show; the rest scroll inside the card. The focused row's help
  sits in two lines under them (left out while a list is open).
- **Foot,** always in view under a rule: the "Don't show at start" tick box
  (`kit::tick`, gold with a dark tick when ticked) and its name on the left, All
  settings and Done (gold) on the right.
- **Keys:** under the card, bottom right: the focused row's, Tab all settings,
  Esc done.

The tick is First setup's own last row (`ui_hideFirstSetup`), pinned out of the
scrolling lines (`ClassicRows::pinned`): the keyboard reaches it after the last
row (Up from the first wraps to it), Enter or a click flips it, Backspace
returns it to its default. Done or Escape goes back to the main page; All
settings or Tab opens the Settings screen on First setup. The pop-up has no
search. Picking the classic style on its Menu style row goes on as that style's
First setup, and picking the SJK UI on the classic one comes back to the pop-up. In a game the SJK UI's First setup is still the classic panel.

### Quick wheel

The quick wheel's pages, edited (since 08/10/2026, Sol's request:
[client.md](client.md#quick-wheels) has what the wheel does). Its category
([wheel_editor.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/settings/wheel_editor.rs), drawn by
[wheel_editor_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/settings/wheel_editor_view.rs))
keeps Settings' top bar (without the search) and rail and fills the rows' and
detail's columns:

- **Pages** (x 470, 360 wide), under a sub-heading: a row each (56 tall), its
  name and how many choices it has, the page whose choices show in gold (a gold
  bar at its left while the focus is elsewhere); the focused row has the band
  and, at its end, Rename, up, down and remove as small round controls (remove
  turns ember while it waits for a second Delete); the Force page's count reads
  "Your powers". Then "+ Add a page" in gold, "+ Add the Force page" in gold
  while that page has been removed, and Restore the default pages (muted; quiet
  "These are the default pages" when they are; ember "Enter again to restore
  them" while it waits for a second Enter). Under a "Sound"
  sub-heading a line below, "Wheel sounds" with the kit's switch
  (`cg_wheelSounds`; the pages column's last row: Enter, Space or a click
  switches it, and the right column says what it does).
- **Choices** (x 870, 400 wide), under "On <page>": each choice's picture (a holo
  ring without one; a custom command's is the `{•}` disc), its name and, muted
  on the right, its group or "Custom";
  the focused one's up, down and remove; then "+ Add a choice". The Force page
  has none: "Follows your Force powers" in gold and a muted paragraph on what
  fills it and how its powers act (since 10/10/2026).
- **Right column** (the detail's, x 1360): the page's ring as the wheel draws
  it at 0.78 of its size, the focused choice highlighted, then facts (Key in
  gold, Bind and Runs in holo) and a line of help. For the Force page the ring
  is an example, a light-side build with Illuminate in the Force bar's pictures,
  Protect marked selected. Picking a choice: its title
  ("Change Rain", "Add to Weather") with Cancel, then the catalogue, 17 lines of
  40 under the groups' sub-headings, the highlighted line on the band, "On the
  page" in gold after actions the page has. A custom choice: its title, what a
  command can be, the Name and Command fields, Cancel and Save (gold).
- **Keys:** bottom right, what has the keyboard's, and Tab for the next group.

Outside the SJK UI the editor draws the same columns on its own over the
classic+ or tabbed settings (the navy ground, "Esc Settings" and "Quick wheel"
as its title), moved 190 left where the rail would be. The editor has its own
canvas (1024 draw commands); every state of a full wheel fits it (a test).

## Servers

[browser.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/browser.rs): the server browser,
opened by Play's Join a server (and by the in-game menu's), over the map darkened
as Settings is, on the main page's 16:9 frame. The camera keeps touring behind it.

- **Top:** the way back (Esc, "Main menu", or "Game menu" from a game), the
  screen's name ("Servers") and the search pill ("Find a server or map", `/`,
  then the number found). The search matches names without their colour codes,
  and map names.
- **Left:** where the servers come from down a lit rail, All servers and
  Favourites with how many of each answered; under "Show", switches for empty,
  full and locked servers and the game type as a cycler (All, then each type);
  at its foot Refresh the list and Join by address.
- **List:** a header line of sortable columns (Server, Mode, Map, Players,
  Ping; the sorted one gold with a sort mark after it, three stacked bars
  longest at the top when descending, at the bottom when ascending; a click
  sorts or flips it), then fourteen rows of 52 that scroll (wheel, scrollbar).
  A row: a gold dot for a favourite, the name in its colours (faded when
  nobody but bots plays), a gold padlock when it needs a password, the game type with
  the mod as a small tag (JA+, JAPRO, Mod; none for base), the map without
  `mp/`, players over capacity, four signal bars lit by the ping (four to 60 ms,
  three to 110, two to 180, one to 400) and the ping. The chosen row has the
  band and gold bar; favourites sort first. An empty list says why (the search,
  no favourite answered, the master server being asked, nothing answered, or
  the Show choices hiding everything).
- **Right:** the chosen server: its map's levelshot (cropped, never stretched:
  a square retail levelshot is a 4:3 picture), the map's name over its foot;
  the server's name in its colours (a second line goes on in the colour the
  first ended in); Mode, Players (with its bots), Ping and Mod (the server's
  own name for its mod once its status answers); its address, "Needs a
  password" in gold when it does, its limits in words ("30 frags, 20
  minutes"); Join (gold) and Add to favourites or Remove favourite; then
  "Playing now", its players with their colours and scores, bots muted, five
  then "and n more" past six.
- **Keys:** bottom right, what has the keyboard's; bottom left, how the list
  stands ("12 servers answered", "Asking the master server...").
- **Prompts:** the password and the address open a card over the darkened map
  (the list is left out under it, since text draws over every shape): its
  title, a line saying what to type, the field (the password as dots), the
  address's error in gold, Cancel and Join or Connect (gold, dimmed while the
  field is empty).

Keys: the list has the shared browser keys (Up and Down, Page Up and Down, Home
and End, Enter joins, F favourite, Tab between all servers and favourites, R
refresh, C an address, `/` search, 1 to 5 sort); Left moves to the left column,
where Up and Down choose, Enter shows a source or flips a switch, Left and Right
step the game type, and Right or Escape return to the list. While the search is
typed, Enter, Down or Tab return to the list (keeping it); Escape clears it.
Escape on the list clears a search first, then returns to the main page. The
pointer: a click on a row chooses it and a second within 0.4 s joins it; a
header sorts; a switch's row flips it; the game type steps back on its left
half and on on its right half.

Joining shows the SJK UI's loading screen (Loading).

## Loading

[loading.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/menu/sjk/loading.rs): what a join shows
from the browser, the main page's recent servers, an address or Create game
until the game is on screen, and a server's change of map. Its keys are the
classic screen's: Escape cancels (back to the browser, or to Create game for a
hosted game; on a server's change of map it leaves the server); after a failure
Escape, Enter or Space return to the browser. The pointer's target is the Esc
key cap at the bottom right only, not the whole screen as on the classic one,
so a stray click does not end a join.

- **Before the map is known** (an address typed or a recent server the list
  does not have; the server's info answer names the map within a second): the
  menu's map stays on show and its camera keeps touring, darkened towards the
  bottom and its left. A block at the bottom left: "Joining" small over the
  server's name large (Rajdhani 56, with its colours: the server list's or the
  recent servers' name, else the address), its address in holo, then a thin
  line 440 long that fills gold by step, and on the bottom row a slowly turning
  gold arc with the step in words. Esc "cancel" sits at the bottom right.
- **Once the map is known** (the browser row's map, the server's answer or the
  gamestate): the map's levelshot fades in over the whole window, never
  stretched (`levelshot::screen_fit`): one as wide as the window or narrower
  covers it, cut at its top and bottom (a square retail levelshot is a 4:3
  picture); a wider one (the HD packs' 2:1 shots, their title against the left
  edge) keeps its whole width with navy bands above and below. It is darkened a
  little all over, more towards the bottom and its left and a touch at the
  top. At the bottom left, from the top: "Joining", the map's own name from its
  worldspawn large (Rajdhani 124, 96 past 18 letters; the file name when it has
  none), its file name without `mp/` small, the server's name (Rajdhani 36, with its colours), then
  the classic screen's lines in words: the game type and limits ("Free for
  all, 30 frags, 20 minutes"; before the gamestate the server list's game type
  and players), the mod and the server's rules ("JA+ Mod v2.6 · Force mastery:
  Jedi Master · Saber only", "No Force powers", "Force-based teams", "Cheats
  on"), and the message of the day (up to two lines, without colour codes). The
  bottom row has the arc and the step, and a thin gold bar runs across the
  bottom of the frame.
- **Steps** (`loading::Step`): Asking the server, Connecting, Receiving the
  game state, Joining the game (the gamestate is in), then once the session is
  in hand Loading <map>, Preparing the graphics and Entering the game; a
  download in progress shows its own line instead ("Downloading x.pk3: 120 /
  900 KiB"). The line and bar fill one seventh a step and never run back within
  a join: on the menu's map the browser's map is first built as a preview,
  which the session's own build replaces, so the world's steps count only for
  the session's world.
- **A failure** keeps the layout of the state it happened in, with "Could not
  join" (or "Connection lost" once the session was in hand) over the name, the
  reason in words on the bottom row instead of the step, no line or bar, and
  Esc "back to servers".
- **A server's change of map**: "Next map" over the server's name. Until the
  new gamestate names the map, the block shows (the classic screen keeps the
  last map's levelshot meanwhile; this one does not), and Esc says "leave the
  server".
- **Starting a hosted game**: "Starting your game" over "Your game" (or the
  game's own name once its gamestate is in), without an address.

The world under the screen: on the menu's map the world keeps rendering under
it (the join's destination loads beside it, as for the classic style) until
the destination's levelshot has faded in, then it is left out
(`ClientMenu::sjk_loading_hides_world`, read by
`menu_backdrop::classic_hides_world`). On a server's world (a change of map, or
the joined world installed before the game takes over) the world is always
left out and the screen draws on the UI's navy ground; the levelshot fades in
over it.

## Scoreboard

[scoreboard/sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/scoreboard/sjk.rs): the scoreboard
held with Tab in a match (and shown at intermission), `cg_scoreboardStyle sjk`.
Its default, `auto`, shows it while `ui_menuStyle` is `sjk` and the classic
scoreboard otherwise; a profile's saved old default (`classic`) moves to it
once, a style chosen after that stays ([client.md](client.md#scoreboard-styles)). No panel: the columns float over
the game, which is darkened by the UI's navy (a third everywhere, deeper behind
the header and, from the chat column's edge, behind the columns). It fades in
and out as the classic board does, settling into place as it opens.

- **Header line:** across the top, as the other screens' top bar: the map
  without `mp/` (Rajdhani 48), then the mode and its limits in words ("Free for
  all · 30 frags · 20 minutes", as the browser words them); on the right the
  time left in a timed match ("12:12 left", else "3:12 played") and your place,
  the screen's one memorable thing, in gold ("3rd", "of 14" after it, "of 14,
  tied" on a tie; "Spectating" when you watch). Team games say "Your team leads
  by 2", "trails by", "Tied at 5" (or which team leads, for a spectator). Under
  the map, "Killed by" and the name while you are dead.
- **Where:** the columns start at x 680 of the frame, right of the chat column
  the scoreboard keeps for messages and the composer (`scoreboard::layout`, 640
  pixels of a 1080-line window), and end at 1824. A compact board is narrower
  and centred (below).
- **Rows:** under muted column labels and a thin holo rule, one row each,
  52 tall at most, with a hairline under it: the place (Rajdhani; ties share
  it), the name with its colours (Exo 2), SJK's emblem right after it for a
  player the hub knows (gold when vouched for, as elsewhere), at intermission a
  gold "Ready", then the score, the deaths when `cg_scoredeaths` counts them,
  the minutes played, and the ping as the browser's signal bars and the number.
  Your row has the UI's band with its gold bar, and its place, score, bars and
  ping in gold. Bots and players still joining are muted, with "Bot", "Joining"
  or "Connecting" for their ping.
- **Compact** (`cg_compactScoreboard`, Settings > Scoreboard > "Compact SJK
  scoreboard", on by default): rows are 32 tall at most and as thin as 20, and
  a list splits in two only when even 20 would not fit, so a full server (32 in
  free for all, or 32 on one team) stands in one column. Names and numbers scale
  with the thinner rows (names 16 to 20, numbers 17 to 22). The board is sized
  from what it shows, not the screen (`sjk::Board`): the name column is as wide
  as the longest name with its emblem, bars and "Ready", measured in the
  families that draw it, at least 140 and at most 320 frame pixels (a longer
  name ends in an ellipsis), the same for both teams; the first number's right
  edge stands 48 after it, each number column is its widest label plus 14 (48
  at least), and the ping column keeps its 100. A player's medal bars are not
  held to a third of the name column as on the full board: the column widens
  for all of them (three at most). The whole board is centred on the screen,
  or, where that would put it over the chat column, stands 40 right of the
  column (as near the middle as the chat allows); it never ends past 1824 or
  grows wider than the full board, the name column giving way (to 100 at the
  least). A duel's cards keep their size about that middle, the players
  waiting centred under them. The dim behind the columns follows the board,
  fading out on both sides, and "Watching" starts at its left edge. In the UI's
  families at 1080 lines (`scoreboard::shot` tests, on the world shot's made-up
  names), a free for all of 8 is 440 frame pixels wide (500 with deaths
  counted) and of 32, 411 (471), centred; a Team FFA of 6 a side is 835 and
  capture the flag of 6 a side 1142, both from 680 beside the chat column
  (four number columns and a player's three medal bars leave capture little to
  gain), against 1144 for the full board in every mode. Off, the sizes below
  apply and the board fills 680 to 1824 as before.
- **Free for all** (and Holocron, Jedi Master): one list by place; once rows
  would be thinner than 34 pixels (past 22 players) two lists side by side, 16
  each at 32. Compact keeps it one list (32 players at 23.6).
- **Team games:** the two teams side by side, red left and blue right, each
  under its head: the team's score in Rajdhani 76 (muted while it trails), the
  team's name in its muted colour with how many play, and a thin rule in that
  colour. Capture modes show score, captures, assists and defends (no minutes,
  for room) and a carried flag's icon before the name. A team too long for
  rows of 26 pixels (20 compact) ends with "and n more", keeping your row.
- **Duel and power duel:** the duelists (`CS_CLIENT_DUELISTS`, else the
  players not spectating) as two facing cards about the board's middle with
  "vs" between them: the name (Rajdhani 44), the score large (112, gold for
  you), the record and health in words ("3 wins · 1 loss · 87 health · 25
  shield"; your health and shield from your snapshot, an opponent's health when
  the server shares it, `g_showDuelHealths`), over a rule, gold under your
  card. A power duel's pair stack two smaller cards facing the lone duelist.
  Under them "Waiting to duel": everyone else in turn, with their record
  (compact: one list up to 21, then two).
- **Spectators:** one line at the bottom, "Watching" then their names without
  colours.

A full server fits the board's canvas (320 text runs, 1024 draw commands) in
every mode, at 1080 lines and 4K, 5:4, 4:3, 21:9 and 32:9 (unit tests, which
also pin the compact board's centring, its clearance of the chat column and
its widths). The look draws in the UI's
families, which load for it even with another menu style when it is chosen on
its own; their metrics place what follows a measured run (the emblem after a
name, the header's right side).

## In-game menu

[sjk_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/sjk_view.rs) draws it,
[sjk_dock.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/sjk_dock.rs) its row of icons and
the match card's controls, [sjk_focus.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/sjk_focus.rs)
holds what the row and the card offer and how the keys move between them, and
[sjk_actions.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/sjk_actions.rs) what they do.
Escape in a match opens it; the match keeps drawing, under a dark fade from the left
edge (deep there, clear by the middle), on the main page's 16:9 frame. Sol asked for
fewer buttons on 09/10/2026: the list has six entries, Team and Vote moved onto the
match card, and Camera control and SJK's pages into a row of small icons (the SJK page
is gone); the same day Achievements became a tab of Profile, leaving six. On
10/10/2026 the Collection (medals, achievements, shaders, toys, nameplates) got an
entry of its own under Profile, making seven.

- **Arc:** a compact version of the main page's: the page's entries on an arc
  whose centre lies off the frame's left edge (radius 580, the middle entry at x
  440), 68 apart (50 for eleven or twelve, 36 for more, smaller type), the
  chosen one gold and larger with a line under it saying what it opens (while the
  list has the keyboard; white and without its line while the row or the card has
  it); a page's name stands small over its first entry. Beside them a lit holo rail
  with a gold mark that eases to the chosen entry, and inside the curve SJK's emblem
  in its turning ring. Leaving entries are ember when chosen; Back and Stay are
  quiet, as is the main page's Leave.
- **Pages:**
  - Main: Resume, Profile (the [Profile screen](#profile-screen), on the tab shown
    last, Character the first time), Collection (the [Collection](#collection), on
    the tab shown last, Medals the first time), Players, Settings, Servers, Leave.
  - Players: a small scoreboard in place of the arc ([identity.md](identity.md#player-reports)):
    the title and how many are on the server (or why the player cannot report, in
    ember), then a table from x 340 to 1330 under a darker fade: a team's colour
    mark, the name in its colours, score, ping ("bot" for a bot) and what the SJK
    hub knows ("Verified" in gold, "SJK" in holo, "You"), 37 apart, sixteen a page
    with More players... and Back; the chosen row has a gold band and edge. The
    card on the right becomes the chosen player's: name, slot and side, what the
    hub knows (key and hub name) and their medals (medallion and name, two a line;
    [identity.md](identity.md#medals)), score and ping, and "Enter: report this player"
    in gold, or why not after an ember mark. Enter opens Report.
  - Report a player: the seven reasons on the arc with what each covers, and Back;
    the player's card stays on the right. Without the right to report, the
    reasons are dimmed and passed over, and Back's line says why. A reason opens
    the report card ([Report a bug](#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs)); Escape
    returns to the player's row.
  - Team (the J key's, `teammenu`): Join the game and Spectate, or in a team game
    Auto-join, Red team, Blue team (each with its colour and players) and Spectate;
    the side the player is on is quiet ("Your team", "You are watching") and passed
    over by the keys. In Siege the card's Class and side opens the class list (the
    shared rows, a row's detail after its label).
  - Call a vote (the card's link): its lists (map, game type, kick, warmup, limits)
    are the shared call-vote lists. Calling a vote returns to the match, as
    retail's pop-ups do.
  - Leave: Leave the server, Quit to desktop (ember when chosen), Stay. It opens on
    Stay, since its rows act at once.
- **Row of icons:** under the emblem, from (96, 852), icons 54 across and 66 apart:
  Camera control (the settings `camera` icon; F8 opens it too), What's new (the
  wheel's `whats_new`), Credits (`credits`), Report a bug (`other_controls`, the
  tools), SJK chat (`text`, the quill) and, only for a staff key (the hub's `staff`
  flag, `profile_card::Summary::staff`), Staff tools (`identity`), dimmer than the
  others. Each is drawn at 78 % (Staff at 50 %) and, hovered or focused, whole with
  a gold ring (bright gold when focused); the one hovered or focused is named over
  the row in gold (Rajdhani 24) with its key cap (F8 for Camera control) and what it
  opens. Only on the main page. What's new, Credits, SJK chat and Staff tools open
  their console pages over the menu, which shows again when they close; Report a
  bug opens the report card; Camera control its panel.
- **SJK chat:** the main page's docked chat ([Main page](#main-page),
  [hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md#in-the-menus)), on the main page only and while
  `cl_sjkChat` is on: under the match between the row of icons and the card (x 860,
  420 wide, from y 750, its Open chat line above the keys), over a soft dark pool of
  rounded layers so it reads over the match. Its messages, field, Open chat and sender
  cards behave as on the main page; a sender's card shows above the dock, where the
  match is clear (shapes never cover text, so beside the name it would lie over the
  dock's lines). Without the identity it says "Turn the SJK identity on to chat", as
  the main page does. Typing in it, every key goes to the field before the console
  key and the game's bindings (`GpuState::sjk_chat_typing`, ahead of
  `route_console_key`); Escape stops typing, and leaving the menu drops the draft.
- **Profile card:** the main page's [profile card](#profile-card), bottom left at
  the same place, under the row of icons, on every page whose arc leaves it room
  (every page of up to twelve entries; not Players and Report a player, whose table
  and player card take the screen). Hovering lights it, a click opens the Profile
  screen on its SJK Profile tab. The Players page's player card shows the chosen
  player's picture (or their initial) before their name when the hub knows them.
- **Match card:** on the right (x 1360, 464 wide) over its own fade: the
  server's name with its colours and its address, a rule, the map without
  `mp/`, its mode and limits in words ("FFA, 30 frags, 20 minutes"), then the
  numbers: the player's score and place ("3rd", "of 14"; "Tied" when tied) or,
  in a team game, both teams' scores (the player's marked "Your team") and the
  player's score, and the clock (time left of the time limit, or played); under
  a rule how many play, watch and fit. It reads the live session each frame and
  the server's info once a second; without a server (a map explored alone) it
  hides, with its controls. On the main page it carries the controls:
  - **The vote on**, over the card from y 166: "A vote is on" in gold with the count
    ("4 yes, 1 no") at the right, the question (Rajdhani 30, two lines at most), and
    Yes and No as gold kit buttons (140 by 40). Voting returns to the match, as
    retail's pop-up does.
  - **Your side**, from y 700 under the numbers: "Your side" and the side (Red team
    or Blue team in its colour, Playing, or Watching), then the kit's buttons, three
    to the card's width: Join red and Join blue (a mark of the side's colour on each)
    and Spectate in a team game, Join and Spectate otherwise, Class and side (200
    wide, Siege's class list) and Spectate in Siege. The side the player is on is
    dimmed and passed over. A side sends `team red`, `team blue`, `team free` or
    `team s` and returns to the match, as the Team page does.
  - **Call a vote**, quiet at the card's foot while no vote is on (muted Rajdhani 21,
    gold and underlined when hovered or focused, with "Map, mode, kick, limits"
    after it), opening the call-vote page.
- **Keys:** bottom centre, what has the keyboard: the list's (Up Down choose, Tab
  icons and match, or icons, match, chat with the chat docked, Enter open, Esc
  resume), the row's (Left Right choose, Tab match, Enter open, Esc list), the card's
  (Arrows choose, Tab list or chat, Enter vote, join, spectate or open, Esc list), the
  chat's (Enter type, Tab list, Esc list; while typing Enter send, Esc stop typing,
  Backspace erase), and a page's (Up Down choose, Enter open, report on Players, write
  on Report a player, Esc back).

Keyboard first: on the main page Up and Down move along the list (passing over
nothing: every entry can be taken); Right from the list enters the card on its first
control; Tab moves the keyboard from the list to the row of icons (its first), from
there to the card (its first control that can be taken), then to the docked chat's
field and back to the list, Shift+Tab the other way, a part with nothing to offer
skipped. In the row Left and Right move between the icons (Right from the last
reaches the chat), Up returns to the list. On the card Left and Right move along a
line of controls (the vote's Yes and No, the side's buttons; Left from a line's first
returns to the list), Up and Down between its lines, nearest the control's place (Down
from the last reaches the chat). On the chat's field Up returns to the list, Left
reaches the row's last icon, Right the card's last control. Enter acts on what has the
keyboard (on the chat it starts typing); Escape stops typing first, returns to the
list from the row, the card or the chat, and from the list resumes the match. A control that goes away (a
vote ends, Staff tools for a key no longer staff) gives the keyboard to the card's
first control, or the list. Escape on a page returns to the main page on the entry
that opened it, or on the card control that did (the side's buttons from Team and
Siege, Call a vote from the call-vote page; a list returns to its row of Call a
vote). The pointer: hovering an entry, an icon or a control gives it the keyboard, a
click acts. Settings and Servers hand over to their screens over the match and come
back on their entry, Settings opened on the category last shown, both with "Game
menu" as their way back; Profile hands over to the Profile screen, which comes back
on Profile. Server info and Controls have no entries: the card shows the server and
Settings holds the key bindings. The Report a bug button the other looks put at the
bottom is left out; the row of icons has it.

The classic menus keep their own in-game bar (`classic.rs`): its Join, Vote, Call
Vote, Profile and SJK pop-up are unchanged, and F8 (or `cameracontrol`) opens Camera
control there.

## Profile screen

[profile_hub.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/profile_hub.rs) (09/10/2026, Sol's requests:
one Profile in the menu for the character and the SJK profile, then one row of tabs
for all of it; 10/10/2026 the achievements, medals and unlockables moved to the
[Collection](#collection)). Existing screens shown as one, under one row of four tabs:
Character, Saber and Force (the player screen's pages) and SJK Profile (the console's
Profile page: picture, bio, record, the achievements and collection in brief). Each
keeps its state, layout, keys and pointer; the row is the player screen's own tabs
grown to four. The same module serves the Collection screen's row
(`profile_hub::Screen`): a tab belongs to one screen, Ctrl+Tab stays within it.

- **Row:** under the title (the player's name, with the way back before it: "Game
  menu" or "Main menu"), from x 96 at y 146, the names in Rajdhani at 26, 48 apart,
  measured from the font (`text::display_width`); the one on show gold with a gold
  underline, one hovered brighter. Whichever screen shows draws it at the same place
  (`profile_hub::tabs`, `profile_hub::header`), so switching between the player
  screen and the console's page keeps the title and the row still; the console's
  page moves what it shows down 44 pixels under it.
- **Keys:** Ctrl+Tab shows the next tab, Ctrl+Shift+Tab the one before, wrapping,
  from any tab and even while a field is typed in. On Character, Saber and Force, Tab
  (Shift+Tab back), `]` and `[` walk all four, as they walked the three pages
  (unless a field there is typed in); on SJK Profile Tab moves within the page, as
  everywhere in the UI. Each tab's keys line names the next tab. A click on a tab
  shows it; the click never reaches the screen under the row (the switch hit-tests the
  row itself, `profile_hub::tab_at`). Escape leaves as each tab's own way back does:
  to the game menu on its Profile entry (the console's page closes over the game
  menu, which waits under it), or to the main page.
- **SJK Profile tab:** the page without its top bar's title (the keyboard starts on
  the picture), its medals left to the Collection and its Identity settings button
  gone (the identity is in Settings, Network); See the board and See the collection
  open the Collection screen on Achievements and Medals.
- **Opened by:** the in-game menu's Profile (the tab shown last in the run, Character
  the first time; the tab a console page turned to itself counts too) and its profile
  card (SJK Profile); the main page's Profile (Character, on the menu map's stage) and
  its profile card (SJK Profile). In the SJK UI the `profile` command opens it on SJK
  Profile (again to close it), returning to the main page from the menus, else to
  the game menu; with the classic menus it opens the page on its own, as before.

## Collection

[collection_panel.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/collection_panel.rs) and its views
(`collection_view.rs`, `collection_medals.rs`, `collection_achievements.rs`,
`collection_shaders.rs`, `collection_toys.rs`, `collection_nameplates.rs`), 10/10/2026,
Sol's request: take the achievements, medals and unlockables out of the Profile screen
into a screen of their own, "a real collection, things players can collect in the
future", with tabs Medals, Achievements, Shaders (the blade skins, renamed: saber now,
body later), Toys and Nameplates (ornaments for the nameplate), then Holocrons (the
loot-box drops, built the same day as a Profile tab and moved here). Sol picked the
direction from a design canvas (`the vault`): every thing has its place from the
start, the ones the player lacks dimmed; each tab shows its things on the left and
the one chosen up close on the right.

It is one console page (like the Profile page), drawn in this look in every menu style:
in the SJK UI the main page's and the in-game menu's Collection (its way back "Main
menu" or "Game menu"), else the `collection`, `achievements` and `unlockables`
commands open it on its own ("Back"); the `holocrons` command opens its Holocrons tab
(the Holocrons page). It remembers its tab and what is chosen on each
for the run.

- **Top:** the way back and "Collection" as the title; at the top right how many of
  all things the player holds ("15 of 30 collected") over a tick for each thing,
  grouped by tab, lit gold for the ones held. Under the title the row of tabs
  (`profile_hub::collection_header`), each name with its count after it in small
  Rajdhani ("2/3", "11/21", how many holocrons for Holocrons; nothing while unknown or empty), the one on show gold and
  underlined. Drawn in Inter (the families not loaded, the classic menus), the row
  makes room for the wider face.
- **Medals:** "2 of 3 medals" (or why they are not known) over a line; every medal
  the client knows hangs by its ribbon from a lit holo rail (x 96 to 1000, y 336, a
  bead at each end), up to 226 apart, the ones given first in colour on a soft gold
  glow, the others dark; under each its name (with the count for one given again) and
  "Given dd/mm/yyyy", "Given 2 times" or "Not given yet". The one chosen has a gold
  mark on the rail at its clasp and a brighter glow; up close on the right (x 1120 to
  1824) the whole medal at 400 on its glow, its name at 54 (gold when given), when it
  was given, what it is for with the saber shader it brings ("Comes with the Glitch
  blade, a saber shader."), the team's note in quotes under "From the SJK team", and
  who sees it. A dotted rail and "More medals will hang here as the SJK team adds
  them." stand under the rail. Left and Right choose; hovering chooses.
- **Achievements:** "11 of 21 unlocked" with a gold bar; then a wall, a row to each
  category (Combat, Duels and flags, Journeys, Community) under its name in its colour
  and "5 of 9", each achievement's medallion (`achievements::medallion`, radius 33,
  104 apart: the ring filling with the count in the category's colour, filled and
  gold once unlocked, the goal inside) with its name under it, the one chosen ringed
  bright gold. Up close on the right: the medallion at radius 104 on a glow, the name
  at 50, the category, what to do, a bar with "19 / 25" and "6 more to go" or
  "Unlocked dd/mm/yyyy"; under it "Next up", the three locked ones nearest to
  unlocking with their medallion, bar and count; and how the counts are kept. It opens
  on the locked one nearest to unlocking. The arrows choose (Up and Down to the next
  category's, near the column).
- **Shaders:** "1 of 5 owned" (or why that is not known) over a line, beside the kinds
  as pills: Saber with its count, and Body ("soon", not offered yet). Then the rack, a
  row of 106 to each: the stock blade first (its swatch in the player's `color1`), then
  every blade skin, each with its live swatch ([unlockables.md](unlockables.md)) alive
  when owned, grey and still under a padlock when not, its name at 28 and its state
  (Worn, Yours, Locked, "In your colour"); the one chosen banded with a gold mark. Six
  rows show at a time (10/10/2026, fifteen no longer fit): the rack scrolls just enough
  to keep the chosen row in view (a pointer over the rows never scrolls it), the wheel
  scrolls it a row a notch, the chosen row kept in view, and a thin bar at its right
  shows where it is. The
  model holds the chosen blade, a locked one too ("Preview on your saber: not yours
  yet" over the stage): the preview is drawn by this screen only and never sent
  (`collection_panel::PreviewSkin`, `menu_stage`'s `skin_override`). Beside the model
  (x 1300 to 1824, from y 618): "Saber shader" or "Your saber", the name at 56 (gold
  when owned) with its state as a tag, what it is, "Yours since dd/mm/yyyy, from the
  SJK team" with the note (", with your Bug Hunter medal" when a medal brings it), or "How to get it: ...", and Equip (gold), Unequip or "Wear
  the stock blade". It opens on what is worn. Up and Down choose, Enter equips or
  unequips (`cg_saberSkin`).
- **Toys:** "1 toy", things to use in a match. Illuminate's holocron (the Force
  wheel's picture) in its niche, ringed gold on a glow, "Everyone's"; a dotted line for
  the toys to come. The holocron floats lit by the model on the stage
  (`illuminate::submit_stage_holocron`); beside the model what it is, how to use it
  and "On the Force wheel" with its switch (`cg_illuminate`, Enter or a click).
- **Nameplates:** none exist yet. "No nameplates yet"; three empty places, dashed, each
  with a drawing of where its kind will go: Crest (before the name), Frame (round the
  plate), Trail (under the plate). Over the model's head (projected from the stage
  model's head with the last frame's view, `GpuState::frame_view`; over the preview's
  head without a stage) the player's nameplate as a match draws it near: the name in
  its colours, the shield, health and Force bars, with dashed marks at the three places.
- **Holocrons** ([holocrons_panel.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/holocrons_panel.rs),
  [holocrons_panel_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/holocrons_panel_view.rs),
  [holocrons.md](holocrons.md#the-holocrons-tab), 10/10/2026, Sol's holocron drops): a
  console page of its own (the Collection's sixth tab; the Collection's row is drawn on it,
  its counts read from the identity, `collection_panel::row_labels`), with the world left clear on the left: a 3D holocron turns
  and bobs there in the look of the tier chosen, with that tier's colour of point light
  (the backdrop camera parks on its own shot: duel6's garden, a cut through dark on the
  tour; the classic style does not hide the world under it); under it the tier's name at 46
  in its colour, a padlock and "None held yet: shown dimmed" for a tier held none of, whose
  holocron shows dark and drained. On the right (x 1000 to 1824, over a dark panel): how
  many holocrons the player holds at 38 (or "Identity is off", "No hub is set",
  "Contacting the hub..." with the reason under it), the four tiers as rows of 60 (the
  tier's picture, its name at 27 in its colour, "60% of drops", the count held at 32 with
  "held" under it, or a dash before the hub answers, a padlock by a zero; the chosen row
  tinted in its colour with a white ring), the chosen tier's description, that holocrons
  cannot be opened yet, "Next holocron in about 20 minutes of play" with "3 of 8 today" and
  a gold bar, and "Recent holocrons" (times in UTC): the newest ten in two columns, each a
  small picture, the tier's name, `dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM` and, for a gift, "Gift from the SJK
  team" with the note. Keys: Up and Down (Left and Right, Tab, the wheel, 1 to 4, Home, End)
  choose the tier, which swaps the 3D holocron at once (it shrinks away and the new look
  grows in); a click on a row chooses it; Ctrl+Tab goes on to Medals; Escape leaves.
  There is no Open: opening does not exist yet. The `holocrons` command opens it as the
  Collection's tab (again to close); the SJK Profile tab's Holocrons block has See holocrons
  (the classic menus' Profile page too, opening the page on its own). Until the
  Collection (10/10/2026, the same day) it was the Profile screen's eighth tab. The classic Profile
  page lists three medals, not four, to make room for that block. World shots:
  `world_shot::holocrons_tab` (`duel6_sjk_holocrons`: each tier, one held none of, the
  identity off, waiting; `duel6_sjk_holocrons_windows`: 4:3, 21:9, 4K, `ui_textScale 1.2`,
  the classic style). Not tried in a game.
- **The model:** behind Shaders, Toys and Nameplates the page darkens only the left
  and the bottom. From the main page the backdrop camera goes to the player's shot
  (`ClientMenu::set_collection_stage`, which first reads the model, sabers and
  cosmetics from the cvars when the player screen is closed) and the model stands on
  the stage (`Backstage::World`); over a match, and in the classic menus, it shows in
  the page's live preview at (760, 110, 820, 840) (`Backstage::Preview`, as the
  in-game Character tab's). Without either the page draws the swatch or the picture
  itself. In a window narrower than 16:9 the words beside the model keep a soft dark
  pad.
- **Keys and pointer:** the keys line names what the arrows and Enter do on the tab,
  Ctrl+Tab and the next tab, Esc back. Ctrl+Tab (Ctrl+Shift+Tab back) changes tab, as
  on the Profile screen; a click on a tab shows it; hovering a thing chooses it; a
  click on Equip, Unequip, the toy or its switch acts.

World shot: `world_shot::collection::duel6_sjk_collection` (every tab from the main
page, the Storm previewed, a 4:3 window, the in-game preview, and the page on its own
in the classic menus; the blade skins from `SJK_TEST_PACKS`).

## Camera control

[shot/sjk_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/shot/sjk_view.rs): the
panel for framing shots ([client.md](client.md#camera-control) has what it
does), opened by the in-game menu's camera icon (its row of icons), F8, the
`cameracontrol` command or the quick wheel's Camera control. Sol renamed it from Shot
controls and asked for this look on 08/10/2026. Its purpose is the scene, so the
match draws undimmed over most of the window, and the panel is a column down the
right edge:

- **Frame:** a 1080-line frame whose right edge is the window's, not the main
  page's centred one, so the column hugs the edge on any window (x 1440, 416
  wide) and a wider window shows more scene. Under it a navy fade, clear at x
  1200, 72 % at 1400, 86 % at the edge, the full height; nothing else darkens the
  scene.
- **Viewfinder:** the screen's one memorable thing. Thin holo corner marks at
  the window's corners (the picture once the panel hides) and small crosses where
  its thirds cross, for placing the subject.
- **Top:** "Camera control" (Rajdhani 42), what it is for, then the pages as tabs,
  Camera and Sun, the one on show gold and underlined (Character's tabs).
- **Camera page:** View from (Back, Front, Left, Right as kit buttons), then
  Framing: Angle, Pitch, Distance and Height.
- **Sun page:** Sunlight: the sun's direction and elevation, a line on what the
  angles mean and one on what holds the sun now (white when Camera control does),
  and Reset sun as a full-width button; without real-time lighting or open sky,
  why the sun cannot be set here.
- **Motion** (both pages, at the same place): Move duration and Orbit speed,
  Orbit, Stop and Reset (Ease back on the Sun page), the Live preview and HUD
  switches, then Hide panel (gold, Move and hide while live preview is off) and
  Close.
- **Sliders:** a row of 56: the name (Exo 2 19) and the number (Rajdhani 21, to a
  tenth, its unit in Exo 2, since Rajdhani's degree sign reads as an apostrophe)
  on one line, the kit's slider across the whole column under them. The
  track's pointer area is exactly the drawn track, so a click or a drag lands
  where it shows; the number is its own area (a click types it).
- **Keys:** two lines at the column's foot, right-aligned: what has the keyboard
  (Left Right adjust and Enter type on a slider, Enter show, switch or act
  elsewhere, Enter apply and Esc cancel while a number is typed), Up Down and F8
  Esc.

The focused control has the kit's band (a slider's or switch's whole row, a tab)
or a button's white edge. It is the panel's state, tokens, keys and pointer
(`shot::Panel`), drawn by another view: `InGameMenu::append_sjk` builds it when
the page is `Page::Shot`. With the classic menus a right-edge panel in SJK's
hero look draws it, renamed.

## Report a bug and its dialogs

[text_dialog_sjk.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/text_dialog_sjk.rs) draws the
text dialog as the SJK UI's pop-up card (Sol's request, 08/10/2026). One dialog
serves three things, and all three take this look with the SJK UI's menus:
Report a bug (the in-game menu's row of icons), a player report's few words
(Players, a player, a reason) and a world note (`worldnote` twice,
[client.md](client.md#player-card)). The classic+ look stays with the classic
menus ([identity.md](identity.md#bug-reports)).

- **Card:** 920 wide and 592 tall, centred on the frame, with the browser
  prompts' glass, shadow and holo edge (`kit::card`), over the scene darkened
  all over as under the other cards (78 %); a note's scene is darkened by half,
  so the surface it is about still shows round the card. The menus and every
  text drawn before it are left out under it.
- **Top:** what it is in gold (Report a bug, Report a player, Note for Claude)
  and, muted on the right, where it goes ("To the SJK team, signed with your
  identity", "Kept on this PC with a screenshot"); the question as the headline
  (Rajdhani 40: "What went wrong?", the player and the reason, "What should
  change here?"), cut with an ellipsis when too long; a line or two of
  guidance (for a note, the surface it is about).
- **Field:** six lines of the text (Exo 2 19) wrapped by the font's width in the
  player's text style (`ui_textScale`, `ui_letterSpacing`; the wrap, the caret
  and the clicks measure as the renderer draws, `text_dialog_field.rs`); the
  lines scroll to keep the caret in view; a gold caret bar at the insertion
  point while it has the keyboard, lit steadily while typing; "Type here" while
  empty (held clear of the caret); outlined white while focused.
- **Under it:** the rules ("Letters, digits, spaces and . , ! ? ' - : ( )
  only") and the count against the limit (600, 300 for a player report, 500 for
  a note; gold at the limit), then why a Send is refused in a warm red band just
  above the buttons: after a Send was refused, and already while Send has the
  keyboard or the pointer and the text would not pass.
- **Foot:** Cancel and Send (gold, dimmed until the text would pass the hub's
  rules; Enter or a click then says why).
- **Keys:** under the card, bottom right: Enter send, Ctrl V paste (while the
  field has the keyboard), Tab next, Esc cancel.

After Send a report keeps its card; the other looks close and show the outcome
as a centre print, as the card does when it was closed first:

- **Sending:** "Sending...", a turning gold arc and "Waiting for the SJK hub" at
  the foot, the text dimmed, Close.
- **Sent:** "Sent. Thank you!" over the hub's number ("The SJK team has it as
  report #12."), a gold tick, Done (gold).
- **Not sent:** "Not sent" over the reason as a sentence: the identity off
  ("The SJK identity is off (cl_identity 1 turns it on)"), the hub out of reach
  or its refusal (a quota); "Your text is kept", Edit (gold: back to the text as
  it was) and Close.

A note closes on Send in every look, since its screenshot is taken of the next
frame; its outcome stays a centre print and a console line.

Keys: Tab and Shift+Tab move between the field, Send and Cancel; Enter sends
(on Cancel, cancels); Space acts on a button and types in the field; Escape
cancels. In the field the text has an insertion point: Left and Right move it
(with Ctrl by words), Up and Down by wrapped lines (from the first line to the
start, from the last to the end), Home and End to the ends of the line (with Ctrl
of the text), Backspace and Delete remove at it (with Ctrl a word), typing and
pasting insert at it within the same limits, and a click puts it between the
glyphs under the pointer. With Send or Cancel focused the arrows walk the buttons. After Send, Enter or Space takes the focused button (Close, Done or
Edit), Tab moves between Edit and Close, Escape closes. The pointer: a click on
the field gives it the keyboard (on a failed report's text, edits it), on a
button acts.

## New medal

[medal_popup/sjk_view.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup/sjk_view.rs): the pop-up
a medal from the SJK team arrives in ([identity.md](identity.md#medals)), on the main
page or over the game menu. Sol asked on 08/10/2026 for its Next button in the SJK
UI's style (it was the retired modern style's) and for the medal to arrive animated,
with a sound. No card: the medal floats in the middle of the scene darkened by the
UI's navy (80 %, coming in over 0.3 s with the sitting's first medal), as the
screen's one memorable thing, on the main page's 16:9 frame.

- **Top:** "New medal" in gold (Rajdhani 24; "New medal · 1 of 3" when several
  wait) over "From the SJK team" (muted, Exo 2 17).
- **Medal:** its whole picture, 340 across, from y 172, centred; behind its
  medallion a soft gold glow, a thin gold ring and a ring of holo ticks turning once
  every four minutes, as the main page's ring does.
- **Words:** the name with its count in gold (Rajdhani 56, centre line at y 600),
  what it is for (Exo 2 20, up to two lines), "Given dd/mm/yyyy" (muted, 16), and
  the team's note in quotes (Exo 2 19, up to five lines of 880, wrapped by measured
  width).
- **Button:** the kit's button (gold, 200 by 46), Next while more wait, Close on the
  last, centred under the words; its pointer area is the pill. A click anywhere
  else acts as it too.
- **Keys:** bottom right, Enter next (or close).

The ceremony ([award.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup/award.rs), shared with
the classic+ look in retail's gold): the medal comes down into place growing from a
third of its size and lands a little past it (ease-out, about 0.5 s), light bursts
from the medallion (glow, two gold rings, a flash, twenty falling sparks), a gold arc
sweeps the ring, a band of light crosses the medal, and the words fade up and rise
into place one group after another, all within 1.8 s. Waiting, the glow breathes,
a softer band crosses every 6 s and six sparkles twinkle. Enter, Space, Right,
Escape or a click finish the entrance at once, then take the button: the medal lifts
away and everything fades in 0.32 s. Only the medal moves on its own, and only
because it arrived. Every moment stays under 260 of the canvas's 320 draw commands
and its 32 text runs, with the button above the keys inside the window (a test
sweeps every medal with no note and the longest ones, alone and first of several,
nine moments, 1080p, 4K, 4:3, 21:9 and 720 lines, in the families and in Inter).

## Implementation

- `ui_menuStyle sjk` (`menu::style::MenuStyle::Sjk`) is the default beside
  `classic`. Every screen without an SJK UI version opens its classic one; the
  main page dispatches to `menu::sjk::home`.
  `ClientMenu::sjk_screen` says when one of the SJK UI's own screens is on show
  (the main page, Settings without a picker open, Character, Servers, the
  loading screen): the map is drawn under it (the loading screen leaves it out
  itself when it has to)
  (`classic_hides_world` leaves it out) and its text goes to the UI's families
  (`append_sjk_screen`).
- The controls are drawn by `menu::sjk::kit` (the band, switch, slider,
  segments, field, list, reset arrow, changed dot, sub-heading, search pill,
  lit rail, cycler, colour chips, button and rank pips), in frame pixels
  (`menu::sjk::Frame`).
- The player screen's style: `PlayerMenu::set_sjk` (from `set_menu_art`) draws
  the screen in the SJK UI's view; `ClientMenu::sjk_screen` covers the
  player phase then, so the map and the stage model show under it.
- Settings is the classic+ panel's state with another view: the menu opens a
  category's rows as the classic+ panels do, keeps `classic_panel` empty and
  marks the SJK UI's screen open (`sjk::settings::SettingsPage`); the rows'
  results (`SettingsResult::Classic` for a category, `ClassicCycle` for Tab) are
  read as the rail's. Pointer tokens are the classic+ panel's (rows, values,
  segments, reset, list, search, scroll), the rail's categories its chrome
  tokens.
- Servers is the browser's state with another view: `ServerBrowser` and its
  pointer tokens (rows, headers, the tabs for the sources, the filter strip's
  for Show, the prompts') are the other styles'. Its keys go first to
  `ClientMenu::sjk_browser_key`, which handles the search, the left column
  (`sjk::browser::BrowserPage`) and Left, and leaves the rest to the shared
  `browser_key`; its pointer to `sjk_browser_pointer` before the shared one.
  The chosen server's levelshot comes through the create-game screen's cache
  (`CreateGame::service_levelshot_for`, which also gives its size).
- The loading screen is the classic loading screen's state with another view:
  `classic::loading::ClassicLoading` (fed by the join, `set_game` and
  `sync_classic_loading`) also keeps the session's world stage and whether the
  session is in hand (`set_world`), a count of joins (`generation`), whether
  the load named its map (`named_map`) and the gamestate's facts in words
  (`sjk::loading::Facts`). The screen's own memory
  (`sjk::loading::LoadingPage`) is the furthest step of the join and the
  levelshot's fade. Its levelshot comes through the same cache, serviced by
  `upload_menu_images` as for the classic screen.
- The scoreboard is the scoreboard module's state with another look:
  `style::ScoreboardStyle::Sjk` (resolved from `cg_scoreboardStyle` and
  `ui_menuStyle`) builds its rows with `scoreboard::sjk::build` on the board's
  own canvas, through the HUD's path (`scoreboard::append_overlay`), not the
  menu's; the text goes to the UI's families (`append_text_families`), or Inter
  until they load. `game_font::prepare` loads the families when the scoreboard
  wants them too. The ping bars are the browser's (`browser::signal`).
- The in-game menu keeps the in-game menu's pages, rows and actions
  (`ingame_menu::InGameMenu`, `Page`): `InGameMenu::is_sjk` picks the SJK UI's
  look (`is_classic` no longer covers it), `sjk_view::prepare` writes the rows
  it words its own way (Main, Team, Leave) with their hints, and
  the shared rows (Siege, the call-vote lists) keep theirs, a "label  /
  detail" row splitting into label and hint. `GpuState::activate_sjk_ui_row`
  acts on its own rows before the shared actions; `back_or_close_game_menu`
  goes to `sjk_view::parent` (the entry that opened the page). The keys pass
  over rows that cannot be taken (`InGameMenu::sjk_step`); a screen handed
  over to returns on its entry (`InGameMenu::return_row`, read by
  `MenuAction::ReturnToGameMenu`). The main page's row of icons and card controls
  are `sjk_focus`'s model (`Icon`, `Control`, `Controls::for_match`, `Focus`,
  `step`), built each frame from the view (`View::staff` from the profile card's
  summary) and kept on `InGameMenu` for the keys (`GpuState::sjk_main_key`) and the
  pointer (`sjk_main_pointer`, tokens 800 for the icons and 820 for the controls).
  The docked SJK chat is `menu::sjk::chat_dock`, which the main page uses too: its
  `Dock` (draft, sender card, the messages shown) and `DockCache` live on
  `InGameMenu`, `InGameMenu::sync_chat` follows `cl_sjkChat` each frame, and its
  tokens are `sjk_view::CHAT_TOKENS` (940 to 948). The
  match card (`sjk_view::Card`) is refreshed from the session by
  `GpuState::refresh_game_menu_card`. Settings
  opened from it is `ClientMenu::open_sjk_settings_from_game`; Settings' and
  Key bindings' top bar take their way back from `settings::Rail::back`. The 2D
  pass now also runs while the game menu is open without a session
  (`frame_overlays.rs`), which an explored map's game menu needed too.
- Fonts: `text::load_family` rasterizes a family's two faces into one atlas, as
  Inter's, taking glyphs a face lacks from its fallback family. The SJK UI's
  families load the first time the style is on, rasterized at 1.5x (glyphs 144
  pixels tall, sharp at 4K), into GPU layers kept by `game_font::GameFonts`.
  `MenuCanvas::set_family` tags each text run with its family
  (`menu_widgets::TextFamily`), and `append_text_families` routes the runs to
  their family's layer. Until the families are loaded the page draws in Inter.
- Snapshots: `menu_snapshot::sjk_home_snapshot` and `sjk_settings_snapshot` draw
  the screens over the JoF HD wide levelshot of mp/duel6, each family from its
  own atlas. `world_shot::tests::duel6_sjk_menu` renders the real frames: the
  client built without a window on duel6, the SJK UI over the touring camera;
  `duel6_sjk_browser` the browser on made-up servers (one answered status),
  a search and the password prompt; `duel6_sjk_loading` the loading screen on
  a made-up join of the JoF server (before the map is known, loading mp/ffa3,
  failed with and without the map known, a server's change of map on the navy
  ground);
  `duel6_sjk_scoreboard` the scoreboard on
  made-up matches (`scoreboard::shot`: free for all with 14 and with 30
  players, the 30 again without compact rows, capture the flag, a duel, a
  power duel, and a 4:3 window), drawn
  without a server;
  `duel6_sjk_ingame` the in-game menu over
  duel6 on a made-up match (`Card::for_shot`, `InGameMenu::sjk_for_shot`):
  the main page without a vote and with one, the keyboard in the row of icons, the
  side's buttons in a CTF, Staff tools shown, a spectator in an FFA, a Siege, Team
  in a CTF, the installed maps to vote for, Leave, a 4:3 window and Settings opened
  from it; `duel6_sjk_chat_dock` the docked chat on made-up messages, on the main page
  (and typing) and in the in-game menu (a sender's card, typing with a vote on), at
  1080p, 4:3 and 4K with the plain text style and `ui_textScale 1.2`; `duel6_sjk_profile_screen` the Profile screen opened from the game menu
  on its Character tab, Ctrl+Tab through the four tabs and round, the game menu's
  Profile opening again on the tab left last, the picture panel with Browse..., a 4:3
  window, and from the main page its Character tab on the menu map's stage, each
  canvas checked not to have run out of room; `duel6_sjk_collection` (in
  `world_shot_collection.rs`) the Collection;
  `duel6_camera_control` Camera control over duel6 on a made-up match: the
  in-game menu with its camera icon focused, the panel's Camera and Sun pages, a number
  typed, the Sun page where the sun cannot be set, a 4:3 window and the classic
  menus' bar and panel;
  `duel6_quick_wheel` the quick wheel's ring over duel6 (General, the change to
  Weather half-way, Weather, the middle, 4:3, in Inter, and three full pages of
  the second board's icons, `duel6-wheel-icons-1` to `-3`) and
  `duel6_quick_wheel_settings` its Settings category (pages, the Force page, the
  sound switch off, a choice, the catalogue, a custom choice, a new page) and the
  editor over the classic+ settings; `duel6_quick_wheel_force` the Force page
  with the powers set for the shot (`duel6-wheel-force-light`, `-dark`, `-every`
  and `-every-2` for Force 2, `-none`, `-no-game`, and the light build at 4K with
  `ui_textScale 1.2`);
  `duel6_sjk_credits` Credits over duel6: the top, Creyon's and Lumaya's
  panels with their folds open and their medals, Creyon's work unfolded, and
  the end of the page.
- The report card is the text dialog's state with another look
  (`text_dialog::Look::Sjk`, set from `ui_menuStyle` by `sync_menu_style`): its
  text, focus, pointer tokens and the hub's rules are the other looks'. A
  report's card holds a `Phase` (writing, sending, sent, failed); the senders
  (`send_bug_report`, `send_player_report`) and their pollers hand it the
  identity service's outcome with `TextDialog::answer`, which shows it when
  the card waits for it and else leaves the centre print to them.
  `GpuState::append_text_dialog` clears every text batch before it (the Inter
  and classic HUD vertices, `GameFonts::clear_text`) and routes the card's text
  to the families; the client menu's draw list is left out under it, as under
  a new medal. Two fixes came with it: the 2D pass now runs while the dialog is
  open without a session or menu (a note written on a map explored alone was
  not drawn), and each layer of the 2D pass starts alpha blended
  (`ui_renderer::art::begin_layer`): a layer ending on the emblem's light, as
  the main page does, drew the next layer's shapes additively. The pointer
  reaches the dialog before the menus, as the keys did. `duel6_sjk_report`
  renders it: the empty report, a long text, a refusal, sending, sent, not
  sent (the identity off, through the client's own path), a player report, a
  note, a 4:3 window and over the main page.
- The new medal pop-up is the medal pop-up's state, queue, keys and pointer with a
  look per menu style (`MedalPopup::set_style`, from `sync_menu_style`):
  `GpuState::append_medal_popup` clears every text batch before it, as for the report
  card, and routes the SJK UI's text to the families (Inter until they load), the
  classic+ look's to the menus' font. `menu_snapshot::medals_snapshot` draws it over
  duel6's levelshot at moments of its ceremony held still, and
  `world_shot::tests::duel6_medal_popup` over the live main page in both looks.
- The quick wheel's ring ([ring.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/quick_wheel/ring.rs))
  is drawn on the HUD's layer with a canvas of its own, its text routed to the
  families when they are loaded (`quick_wheel::append`), else to Inter; it does
  not load them itself.

## Plan

The next screens, in order; each gets snapshot tests before it replaces its
classic version:

1. The dialogs (the import page). The report box
   ([Report a bug](#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs)) and Credits are done
   (08/10/2026).
2. Settings' search finding key bindings too (it finds settings; Key bindings'
   finds keys).
3. Create a game.

`sjk` became the default `ui_menuStyle` before these were done. mp/duel6 has
its tour, player stage and saber shot.
