# Player identity and the SJK hub

SJK players can be recognised across servers without accounts or passwords. Each
install keeps an Ed25519 key; a small web service, the SJK hub, maps public keys to
the in-game names they have worn, an optional bio and a "verified" flag its operator
sets; and while a player is on a game server, their client tells the hub which slot
they are in, so other SJK clients can mark that player on the scoreboard and put a
gold verified badge after a verified player's nameplate. A player does nothing: the
key is made, registered and kept up to date on its own, under the name they play
with. The game works without the hub; the badges and profiles are an extra.

This page is the design and the current limits. The player-facing summary is
[client.md](client.md#identity).

| The hub itself and its protocol | repository Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub (`PROTOCOL.md`) |

The hub is a separate repository because it is deployed on its own schedule. The
client and hub each carry the protocol types; `PROTOCOL.md` has a signed-request test
vector that both test suites check, so a drift in either shows as a failing test.

## What happens

1. With `cl_identity` on (the default), the first start creates `identity.key` in
   the settings folder beside `config.cfg`. With it off, no key is made.
2. With `cl_hubUrl` set, a worker thread registers the key at the hub (a request
   signed by the key, which proves the client holds it) with the in-game name the
   player wears (the `name` setting), and fetches its profile. When the name changes
   it registers again with the new one. The hub keeps each key's worn names (20 most
   recent, with when it first and last saw each), and a profile's name is the one
   worn last unless the operator gave the key another. Nobody chooses a hub name, so
   two keys may wear one name: the name proves nothing, the key does.
3. While the client is in a live, non-local session, the thread repeats a *claim*
   every 45 seconds: "this key is in slot N of server S, shown as NAME". Claims
   live 90 seconds at the hub and are withdrawn when the player leaves or quits. A claim
   also says `"active": true` while the player is actively playing (in their own view,
   mid-match, out of the menus, with input in the last two minutes), which is how the hub
   counts play time toward the next holocron ([holocrons.md](holocrons.md#earning)); the
   flag is left out otherwise.
4. The thread reads the hub's list of claims for the server every 15 seconds. The
   scoreboard marks a row with SJK's emblem, in gold when verified, the player card
   shows the hub name, and a verified player's nameplate gets a gold badge after the
   name (`ui_renderer/verified_badge.rs`, read once a second), when a claim names
   that slot and its claimed name matches the name the game shows there (compared
   after lower-casing and dropping colour codes and symbols). The local player's own
   plate (`cg_nameplateSelf`) has the badge when their own key is verified.
5. Once a claim is accepted the thread also tells the hub the player's *look* (the
   blade skin they wear and whether their Illuminate holocron is lit), which lives on
   the claim; other SJK clients on the server read it from the claims and the feed and
   draw it, under the same name rule as the badges ([Unlocks and
   looks](#unlocks-and-looks)).

Verification is the operator's alone (the hub's `verify` command or its operator API,
which list every key with its worn names); a player asks for nothing and sets nothing.

Nothing blocks a frame: the viewer compares settings and place with what the thread
was last told twice a second, and the scoreboard re-derives its marks only when the
hub's roster or its own rows change. While registered, the thread also reads the
player's own profile again every ten minutes, so the verified flag and medals the SJK
team changes reach a running client. It reads it sooner, at most once every 30
seconds, when its unlocks look out of date: the hub refused a blade skin
(`not_unlocked`), or the feed relayed a look of the player's own key, newer than the
last one sent, with another blade skin (staff took it back).

## What a badge proves

A badge says "a registered SJK key claimed this slot under this name". It does not
prove the player in that slot holds the key, because stock and JA+/JoF servers
publish only fixed fields of a player's userinfo to other clients (SJK's own server
does the same, `bridge_userinfo.rs`), so nothing in-band can carry a proof. The
hub limits the damage: a claim fails while another key holds the same slot under
the same name, display names that normalise to another's are refused, and the claimed
name must match what the game shows. The worst a false claim does is label someone
else's slot with the claimant's own profile; it cannot take another key's name or
verified flag. Badges are for recognition, not for granting anything.

A confirmed tier (SJK's own server adding a hub-signed ticket to the player string)
is planned, not implemented.

## Privacy

With `cl_identity` on and `cl_hubUrl` set the hub receives the player's public key
and in-game name at start and whenever the name changes, the game server address,
slot and in-game name for as long as they play, and sees their IP address. Claims
are deleted 90 seconds after they stop being repeated; profiles and the worn-name
history stay until the operator removes them. While a claim lives, it carries the
player's look (blade skin and Illuminate), dropped with the claim, and whether the
player is actively playing. Since holocrons (10/10/2026) the hub also keeps, until the
operator removes the identity, the key's active play time carried toward the next
holocron, when it last claimed and every holocron dropped for it (tier, time, source, a
staff note and the address it dropped from, for a per-address limit); the profile lists
the counts and recent holocrons publicly and legendary and mythical drops are told to
every SJK client with the key's hub name ([holocrons.md](holocrons.md#what-the-hub-stores-and-privacy)). Once registered, the client also asks for the hub's list of
asset packs at start and every 6 hours and downloads the packs it lacks, which tells the
hub which packs the key fetched and when ([Asset packs](#asset-packs)). With either setting
off the client sends nothing. Since 06/10/2026 `cl_hubUrl` defaults to `https://sjk.dfox.app` so players
set nothing: a default install makes a key and tells that hub where it plays and whether it is active. The
Identity page, the setting's help and the changelog say what is sent and that
`cl_identity 0` stops it.

A bug report (Escape, SJK, Report a bug) is sent only when the player presses Enter
on it: its text, the map, the client build, the game server's address and the in-game
name the player wears, signed with the player's key. The hub keeps it until the operator removes it.

A player report (Escape, Players, or Escape, SJK, Report a player) is sent only by a
verified player who chooses a player and a reason and presses Send: the reason and its few
words, the reported player's slot and the name the game shows for them, the key the hub's
presence list shows in that slot (if any), the server's address and name, the map, the
build, the match clock and the in-game name the reporter wears, signed with the reporter's
key. The hub keeps it until the operator removes it.

A world note (`inspect` twice on the world, [client.md](client.md#player-card)) is sent
only when the player sends it, with `cl_identity` on: its text, the map, the build, the
game server's address, the in-game name the player wears, where the player stood (`setviewpos`), the aimed point, shader,
surface and entity, and a smaller copy of its screenshot (at most 1280 x 720), signed
with the player's key. The note dialog says so. The hub keeps it until the operator
removes it; the full note and screenshot stay on the player's PC either way.

A picture ([Pictures](#pictures)) is sent only when the player presses Use this
picture (or types `sjkavatar <file>` and then presses it): a 128-pixel square PNG the
client made from their file, signed with their key. Nothing else of the file goes:
not its name, its path or its metadata, and the hub writes its own copy holding the
pixels only. The picture is public, like the hub name: anyone may read it at
`/v1/avatar/<key id>`, and every SJK client that shows the player downloads it. The
hub keeps it until the player takes it down, the SJK team does, or the operator
removes the identity. Showing other players' pictures asks the hub for them by key
id, so the hub sees which players a client looks at (it already sees the servers it
plays on); they are kept in `avatars/` in the settings folder.

## Bug reports

[bug_report.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/bug_report.rs) and
[report.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/report.rs). While the game menu is open, a Report a
bug button sits centred at the bottom of the screen (also Escape, SJK, Report a bug); it
closes the game menu and opens the text dialog
([text_dialog.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/text_dialog.rs)): a panel in the middle of the
screen with a text box, a character count, Send and Cancel (Escape cancels too). The text
has an insertion point (Left, Right, Up, Down, Home, End, Backspace, Delete, Ctrl for
words, a click in the box) and a Send the rules refuse says why in a red band. As it is
typed or pasted, only letters and digits of any
script, spaces and `. , ! ? ' - : ( )` are kept (line breaks become spaces), up to 600
characters. Enter or Send checks the hub's rules (a refusal is shown in the panel, which
stays open) (10 to 600 characters, a few real words, no
long run of one character) and hands the report to the identity service, which sends
`POST /v1/report` signed with the player's key; the outcome (the hub's report number,
or why it refused, for example a quota) shows on the SJK UI's card, which waits for it
([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs)), else as a centre print. The report carries the
in-game name the player wears (the service fills it from the `name` it already sends the
hub); the hub keeps it with the report and adds it to the key's worn names. The hub checks
everything again and limits reports per key (3 a day, 20 once verified, 5 an hour, no
repeat within a day), per address (3 in 10 minutes) and overall (300 a day, 5000 kept),
so a troll with fresh keys gets little through and nothing that is not plain words. The
operator reads them with the hub's `reports` command or `/admin/v1/reports`.

## Player reports

[players.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/players.rs) and
[player_report.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/player_report.rs). The game menu's Players page
is a small scoreboard of everyone on the server: each connected client's name, side, score
and ping (the client asks the server for scores every two seconds while it shows) and what
the hub knows of them (an SJK player, or a verified one, from the presence list), sixteen a
page with More players... and Back under them. The SJK UI draws it as a table with the
chosen player's card on the right (main page > Players); the classic menus list it in the
SJK pop-up's Report a player. Enter on a player opens the Report page: seven
reasons (cheating, harassment or hate, griefing, exploiting a bug, an offensive name, spam
or advertising, something else) and Back. A reason closes the menu and opens the text
dialog for a few words (10 to 300 characters, the bug reports' alphabet and noise rules);
Send hands the report to the identity service, which sends `POST /v1/player-report`
signed with the player's key, and the outcome (the hub's number, or why it refused) shows
on the SJK UI's card, else as a centre print. The player is copied when chosen, so the
report names them as they were.

Only a verified SJK player may report (`player_identity::report_gate`): with the identity
off, the hub not answering yet, an unverified key or a game on this PC, the Players page
says why under its title (the classic pages in their first line), and the Report
page's reasons are dimmed, Back carrying the reason; yourself and bots cannot be reported
either. The service refuses an unverified key before anything is sent, and the hub checks
everything again: verified keys only, a live claim of the reporter on that server, nobody
reports themselves, 3 an hour and 10 a day per key, one report per key about one player a
day (the same server and name, or the same key), 20 a day about one player from everyone,
3 in 10 minutes per address, 300 a day and 5000 kept overall. The hub names the reported key
from its own live claim on that slot when the names match, else takes the client's. The
operator reads them with the hub's `player-reports` command or `/admin/v1/player-reports`
(also by reported key) and decides what to do.

## World notes

[world_notes.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/world_notes.rs). A world note
([client.md](client.md#player-card)) is kept on the player's PC as before and, with the
identity on, also goes to the hub for the SJK team. The note dialog keeps the bug
reports' alphabet as it is typed, and Send checks the hub's note rules (3 to 500
characters, at least 2 letters, no long run of one character). The identity service
sends `POST /v1/note` with the text and the selection: map, build, server, `view` (the
`setviewpos` x, y, z and yaw), the aimed point and normal, shader, BSP surface,
lighting, distance and the entity's class name (a name outside the hub's alphabet is
left out rather than the note refused), and the in-game name the player wears, as for a
report. The hub answers with the note's number, which a
centre print and the console show, or why it refused. The screenshot writer also makes a
smaller JPEG of the same pixels (`capture::preview_jpeg`: fitted within 1280 x 720,
quality lowered until under 380 KiB) and hands it to the service, which sends it with
`PUT /v1/note/<id>/image` once the hub took the note; a picture that fails leaves the
note as it is. The hub limits notes per key (20 a day, 200 once verified, 30 an hour, no
repeat of the same text about the same shader within a day), per address (40 notes and
pictures in 10 minutes) and overall (1000 a day, 3000 kept), and takes a picture only
from the note's sender, once, within 10 minutes. The operator lists notes with their
pictures with the hub's `notes` command or `/admin/v1/notes`.

With the classic menus (`ui_menuStyle classic`) the dialog and the button take the
classic+ look ([text_dialog_classic.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/text_dialog_classic.rs),
[classic-plus.md](classic-plus.md#pages)): the in-game pop-up box with its title band,
the text in a retail list box, gold Send and Cancel, the description line under the box,
and a gold REPORT A BUG on retail's red band at the bottom of the canvas. With the SJK UI
the dialog is its pop-up card and there is no button (Report a bug is on the in-game
menu's row of icons): [sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs).

## Medals

A medal is recognition the SJK team gives a player by hand: for testing SJK early,
contributing to its code or finding bugs. Since 10/10/2026 (Sol's decision) each medal
brings one saber shader for as long as the player holds it: Early Tester the Hologram
blade, Early Contributor the Runic blade, Bug Hunter the Glitch blade. The hub derives
it from the medal and takes it back with the medal's last award, off the player's look
too ([unlockables.md](unlockables.md#decisions)). Nothing else comes with a medal: no
setting, power or right, on any server. Players do not ask for medals or choose them;
the SJK team gives them.

| Medal | Id | For | Given again |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early Tester | `early_tester` | Helped test SJK in its early days. | no |
| Early Contributor | `early_contributor` | Contributed to SJK's code in its early days. | no |
| Bug Hunter | `bug_hunter` | Found bugs that got fixed. | yes, with a count ("Bug Hunter x2") |

The hub lists a key's medals in its profile (`"medals":[{"id","count","awarded","note"}]`:
the count, when it was last given and a short note from the team, often empty) and in its
presence entry (`id` and `count` only), so the scoreboard needs no request per player.
Lists come in the table's order; a client shows only the ids it knows and older hubs
send none. The catalogue is [medals.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medals.rs): each medal's
name, description, ribbon colours and two pictures in `assets/medals` (`<id>.png`, the
whole medal on its ribbon, 512 square; `<id>_small.png`, the medallion alone, 128
square, for anything under about 64 pixels). A new medal is one entry there and two
pictures; new art is a file replacement. The JoF Clan medal (`jof_clan`) was dropped on
10/10/2026 for the [JoF clan tag](#jof-clan-tag); a client ignores an old award of it as
an unknown id.

Where they show:

- The scoreboard, every style: up to three small ribbon bars after the SJK emblem, on
  rows whose claim the emblem trusts (the claimed name matches the name the game shows).
  They are coloured rectangles drawn from the catalogue (Early Tester amber with black
  stripes, Early Contributor navy with a white centre stripe, Bug Hunter emerald with
  black edges), sized after the emblem; they take room from the name,
  never the columns, and fewer show where the name would keep less than half its room
  (the SJK UI: a third). Derived only when the roster or the rows change.
- The player card (`inspect`): the medallions in a row under the hub name; a pinned card
  names them too in small print, with a repeatable one's count.
- The SJK UI's Players page: the chosen player's card lists their medallions and names.
- The Identity page: the player's own medals, each with its whole picture, name and
  count, description, the date it was given (`dd/mm/yyyy`) and the team's note; with
  none, a line saying the SJK team gives medals for testing, contributing and more.
- The new medal pop-up ([medal_popup.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup.rs)): the
  first time the client sees a medal in the player's own profile, or a repeatable one's
  count rise, it shows it once, large, with its name, description, date and note, and
  several show one after another ("1 of 3"). It
  opens on the main menu, or when the game menu opens in a match, never over play: a
  medal that arrives during a match is announced once by a centre print pointing to the
  game menu. While it shows, the menu under it is neither drawn nor given input. What was
  shown is kept in `medals_seen.txt` beside `identity.key` (the key id, then one
  `<id> <count>` a line; ids the build does not know are kept), so each medal and each
  new count shows once per identity, and an install that already held medals when it
  first read its profile still shows them. A medal counts as shown when its button is
  taken.

  Each medal arrives in a ceremony ([award.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup/award.rs),
  since 08/10/2026, Sol's request: animated like the achievements, with a sound). Over
  1.8 seconds the whole medal comes down into place on its ribbon, growing from a
  third of its size a little past its own and settling; as it lands (about 0.5 s) light
  bursts from the medallion: a glow, two gold rings running out, a flash, and twenty
  sparks thrown out and falling. A gold arc sweeps round it and stays as a thin ring,
  with a ring of ticks outside it that turns as slowly as the main page's ring; a band
  of light crosses the medal (its own picture drawn again brighter, so the light keeps
  to its shape); and the words fade up one group after another: what it is, the name,
  what it is for and the date, the note, then the button. While it waits it breathes:
  its glow swells and fades over 4.2 s, a softer band of light crosses it every 6 s
  and six sparkles twinkle round it. Enter, Space, Right, Escape or a click (on the
  button or anywhere else) during the entrance finishes it at once; once it stands
  still they take its button, Next (Close on the last): the menus' click plays and the
  medal lifts away and fades in a third of a second before the next comes. Everything
  is draw-list shapes of a fixed number (no allocation a frame); the ceremony waits up
  to 1.5 s for the medal's picture, which is decoded as soon as a medal is queued.
  Each medal's arrival plays the multiplayer game's own fanfare, `music/goodsmall.mp3`
  (its cgame's `happyMusic`, played to the player who becomes the Jedi Master), through
  the interface sounds; without the file (no game data) it is silent. The look follows
  the menus: the SJK UI's ([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#new-medal)) or the classic+ one
  ([classic-plus.md](classic-plus.md#pages)).
- `debug_medal` ([rehearsal.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup/rehearsal.rs))
  rehearses receiving medals offline: `debug_medal <id> [x<count>] [note]` (a count for
  Bug Hunter only), `debug_medal all [note]` for every medal, `debug_medal` alone for the
  ids. It makes the list a hub profile would carry (dated today), which is read as the
  hub's is and queued like a real arrival, so the centre print in a match, the pop-up
  on a menu, the ceremony, the fanfare and Next can all be tried; the console closes so
  it shows at once over a menu. Nothing is sent to the hub, and rehearsed medals are
  never written to `medals_seen.txt`, so a medal the team gives later still shows (a
  real medal arriving replaces its rehearsal still waiting).
- The credits page's cards: not from the hub but from credits.txt's `medal:` lines,
  which use the same ids (Creyon and Lumaya wear Early Contributor), so a contributor's
  card shows its medals without a request; the SJK UI draws each whole with its name
  and description beside the card's lines, the other looks as chips (medallion and
  name) after the counts ([client.md](client.md#credits-page)).
- Not on nameplates.

Medals are public: anyone can read a key's profile and the presence list of a server,
so a player's medals, counts, dates and notes are visible to everyone, as their hub
name and verified flag are. The client sends nothing about medals.


## JoF clan tag

A player whose name carries the JoF clan's tag gets the clan's emblem (J, o, F) on the
left of their name, tinted crimson. It is read from the name alone, so it shows what a
player says, not something the hub vouches for; it needs no hub and no SJK identity.
[jof_tag.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/jof_tag.rs) holds the rule, the size and the drawing.

The rule (the clan's): `jof` in any case, with no letter right before the J (the name
starts there or a separator comes first: a space, a bracket, a dot, a digit...) and no
letter right after the F. Colour codes are dropped first. `{JoF}Name`, `jof.Name`,
`[JOF] Name`, `Name-JoF` and `^1J^7oF` count; `Joffrey`, `MrJoF` and `Jofa` do not. Any
Unicode letter counts as a letter.

Where it shows: the game chat's name rows, SJK chat lines in the feed, the SJK UI's chat
dock and chat page, the scoreboard (classic and SJK, list rows and duel cards), the player
card (`inspect`) and the SJK UI Players page's card. Not on nameplates.

The emblem is `assets/branding/jof-emblem.png` (128 square, white on transparent, one icon
atlas cell), rendered from the clan's SVG path by `scripts/jof_emblem.py`.

## Unlocks and looks

Unlocks are cosmetic things a key owns, granted by the hub's operator or staff
(design, catalogue and status: [unlockables.md](unlockables.md)); the first is the Sun
blade. A profile lists them (`"unlocks":[{"id","granted","note"}]`, the catalogue's
order; older hubs send none, `Profile::unlocks`). Staff grant and take one back with
`StaffRequest::Unlock` and `StaffRequest::Relock` (`/v1/staff/unlock`,
`/v1/staff/relock`); the answer is the target's profile, which replaces the player's
own when it is theirs, as for medals.

A *look* is what a player wears that others draw: `{"saber":"..","illuminate":..}`, a
blade-skin unlock id or `""`, and whether the Illuminate holocron is lit.

- Sending: the viewer computes the own look twice a second from `cg_saberSkin`, kept
  only while the own profile lists that unlock and the client knows the id, and the
  local Illuminate, and hands it to `Service::set_look` when it changes. The worker
  keeps the latest and sends `POST /v1/look` once its claim is accepted, again when
  the look changes or the claim does (another server, slot or name), at most once a
  second (changes in between are coalesced, the latest wins). When what the hub holds
  is unknown (at the start, after a failed claim or a failed release, when an older
  claim may still be live with a look) the next accepted claim gets the look even if
  it is none. A `not_unlocked` or `bad_look` answer leaves that skin out (the look
  goes with `saber:""`, so Illuminate still syncs) until the profile's unlocks change,
  and a `not_unlocked` has the own profile read again soon (at most once every 30
  seconds); too many (429: `look_quota`, or the address's `rate_limited`), a refused
  signature (401, the clock still off after the one retry) and failures wait 10
  seconds and go again; another refusal (an older hub) is not repeated until the look
  or the claim changes. Leaving sends nothing: the release drops the look. `Snapshot::look_outcome` says what became of the last one.
- Receiving: presence entries carry `look` (`Presence::look`) and the feed carries look
  events (`Feed::looks`, `LookEvent`), queued for the viewer (`Service::take_looks`, the
  newest 64, handing over only those read for the viewer's server under the feed's
  current generation, `ReceivedLooks`; a new generation clears the viewer's hub looks). The viewer's `looks.rs` keeps one look per slot: the roster's when it
  changes, the feed's as they come (newer, so they win until the roster changes
  again), counted only while the game shows the claimed name in that slot, and cleared
  on another server. The local player's own look comes from its settings.
- Others' Illuminate shows by their left shoulder ([client.md](client.md#illuminate));
  blade skins are drawn by the saber renderer from `Looks::saber_skin_id`.

Looks are public to every SJK player on the server, as badges are.

## Asset packs

The art of the unlockable cosmetics (each blade skin's look and sounds) is not part of
SJK's code: the hub serves it as *asset packs*, PK3 files (`PROTOCOL.md`, "Assets"), so
every SJK client can draw every player's look. The identity worker keeps a copy of
each in `assets/` beside `identity.key` (`assets::FOLDER`), one `<name>.pk3` per pack,
once the viewer gives it that folder (`Service::keep_assets`); the viewer mounts the
packs it finds there (`assets::cached_packs`).

- `GET /v1/assets`, signed: the list, `{"packs":[{"name","size","sha256"}]}`, sorted by
  name. A pack name is 1 to 32 of `a` to `z`, `0` to `9` and `_`, a size at most 16 MiB
  and a hash 64 lowercase hex digits; a list breaking any of that is refused whole.
- `GET /v1/assets/<name>`, signed: the pack's bytes, read with a timeout of two minutes
  and no more than 16 MiB of them.

The worker reads the list only with the identity on, a hub and the key registered: at
once after the registration (so at start, and again after the identity is switched off
and on or the hub changes), then every 6 hours. It downloads a listed pack only when the
folder has no `<name>.pk3` of the listed size and SHA-256. A download must be the
listed size and hash, or it is refused and nothing is written; a good one goes to a
temporary file in the same folder (`.<name>.pk3.part`), flushed to disk, then renamed
over `<name>.pk3`, so the folder never holds a partial pack under a pack's name and an
error leaves the old one as it was. Packs the hub no longer lists stay in the folder.
`Snapshot::packs_revision` counts the packs written, so the viewer knows to mount them
again, and `Snapshot::assets_note` says what the last check did, for the log.

A check that falls short (the hub out of reach, a 5xx, too many downloads (429), a
refused signature (401), a pack unlike its listing, the disk) is tried again after a
minute, then two, doubling up to 6 hours; one that succeeds puts the next 6 hours on.
Another 4xx (an older hub without assets answers 404) waits the full 6 hours. Packs are
cosmetic: none of this changes the identity's status. Offline, or with the identity
off, nothing is downloaded and the packs already in the folder are used as they are.

The hub sees which packs a key downloads and when, and the address the requests come
from: they are signed by the key. It allows 20 downloads an hour per address, and the list counts
toward its general 30 requests a minute. Packs are SJK's, all rights reserved, served
only to registered keys; a client keeps them to draw looks and does not pass them on.

## Profile

The Profile page (the SJK UI's [Profile screen](sjk-ui.md#profile-screen), its SJK
Profile tab, opened by the main page's Profile and profile card and the in-game menu's
Profile; the classic menu's SJK page and in-game SJK menu; or the `profile` command) is the player's SJK profile as other players read it
on the hub, in the SJK UI's look in every menu style:

- who they are: the hub name with its colours, Verified by the SJK team or not yet,
  the date the key was registered (`Member since`) and up to three other
  names worn (the switch, the key and the hub are on the Identity page, in Settings,
  Network, since 09/10/2026);
- their record, from the achievement counts kept on this PC (players defeated, saber
  kills, best streak, duels won, flags captured, maps and servers played, time
  played) and the last four achievements unlocked;
- the bio, written in a box of up to 6 lines (Enter saves, Shift+Enter starts a new
  line, Revert puts back the hub's copy), with its counts, the hub's answer and the
  rules in a line under it;
- their medals (picture, name, date given; on its own only) and how many
  achievements are unlocked, with See the board, and how many saber shaders are owned,
  with See the collection: both open the [Collection](sjk-ui.md#collection), where the
  medals hang on a rail (every medal the client knows, the ones given first with their
  whole picture, when they were given, what they are for and the team's note, the
  others dark as not given yet) and the achievements stand as a wall of medallions by
  category (below; the `achievements` command opens it). With the identity off, or the hub out of reach, the page says so: the bio cannot
be written and the record and board show this PC's counts.

The player's picture stands at the top of the left column ([Pictures](#pictures)): a
click on it (or Enter on it) opens the picture panel in the bio's place. The profile
card in the bottom-left corner of the SJK UI's main page and in-game menu
([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#profile-card)) opens the page too.

### The bio's rules

A bio is free text every player can read, so it keeps to what SJK's fonts draw and
to nothing that hides, reorders or piles characters up. Before it is checked, line
ends become `\n`, each line's runs of spaces and tabs become one space and its ends
are trimmed, and runs of blank lines become one. Then it must hold at most 500
characters, at most 6 lines, no run of one character longer than 8, and only Latin
letters (with their accented and extended forms, Vietnamese included) and Cyrillic
ones, ASCII digits, the space, newlines, ``. , ! ? ' " - : ; ( ) [ ] & / + # @ % * _ =
~ < > | $`` and colour codes (`^` and a digit). That refuses emoji, symbols, combining
marks (no piled-up "Zalgo" text), zero-width and direction-changing characters, other
spaces, private-use and unassigned code points and control characters.

[bio.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/bio.rs) holds the rules, and the hub's copy is the
same code. They are applied three times: the bio box (and the Identity page's field)
cannot type what a bio cannot hold; the client checks the whole bio before sending it
and says which rule it breaks; the hub refuses a bio that breaks one (`bio_length`,
`bio_characters`, `bio_lines`, `bio_noise`). And whatever a hub sends back, the
client shows a bio only through `bio::for_display`, which drops what the rules
refuse, so a bio stored before the rules, or a foreign hub, cannot put anything else
on screen. A bio is plain text: nothing in it is ever a link or markup.

## Pictures

A player may show a small square picture beside their name (08/10/2026, Sol's
request). The hub's side is `PROTOCOL.md`, "Pictures", in Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub: the
client needs a hub with it, or profiles carry no `avatar` and the stand-ins show.

**Choosing one.** The picture panel's **Browse...** (09/10/2026, Sol's request) opens
the system's file dialog, listing PNG, JPEG and TGA files, through the `rfd` crate
(0.17.2; on Linux the desktop portal, reached through `libdbus` loaded at run time, so
the build needs no GTK). The dialog runs on a worker thread, so the game keeps drawing;
a second Browse... while it is open does nothing, and the file chosen is read as a
dropped one. A picture file dropped on the window (a PNG, JPEG or TGA, known by its
extension, at any time; while the Profile page shows, any file but a `.cfg`, so the
page can say why it is no picture) or named to `sjkavatar <file>` opens the Profile
page (in the SJK UI the Profile screen's SJK Profile tab) on its picture panel. A worker thread reads the file (at most 16 MB) and decodes
it with the `image` crate the client already uses (at most 8192 pixels a side and 256
MB of memory), crops it to a square from its middle, scales it to 128 x 128 by area
averaging and writes it as a PNG of the pixels only (RGB when every pixel is opaque,
else RGBA).

The file is checked before anything is sent, whatever its name says
([avatars/picture.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/avatars/picture.rs), tightened
09/10/2026): it must hold bytes and be a file; its content must be a PNG or JPEG (by
its signature) or, as a TGA has none, a file named `.tga` that decodes as one, so a
program, a GIF, a WebP or a BMP is refused whatever it is called; it must decode
whole (a PNG cut short or damaged fails its checksums, a JPEG must reach its end
marker after its first scan, as the decoder fills in a file cut short); it must be
64 to 8192 pixels a side (64, the hub's own least: a smaller picture made 128 across
is a blur) and at most four times as long as it is wide; and its middle square must
show something (not every pixel clear). The hub checks again: square PNGs of 64 to
1024 pixels and 256 KB, re-encoded.
The panel shows it large, round and ringed as everyone will see it, "This is how it
will look"; **Use this picture** sends it. Done, Escape or closing the page drops a
picture not sent. **Remove picture** (a second press within 3 seconds) or
`sjkavatar clear` takes the player's picture down. The panel says what went wrong in
the player's words: not a picture SJK reads ("use a PNG, JPEG or TGA"), an empty file,
too big, too small ("at least 64 pixels a side"), too narrow or too wide, nothing to
see, damaged or cut short, unreadable, the identity off or the hub out of reach, or
the hub's own refusal (too many changes, stopped by the SJK team).

**Sending.** The identity service's worker sends it, signed, once registered:
`PUT /v1/avatar` with the PNG (at most 256 KiB, refused before sending when larger),
`DELETE /v1/avatar` to take it down (`Service::set_avatar`, `Service::remove_avatar`;
the outcome in `Snapshot::avatar`). The hub answers with the profile, whose `avatar`
is the new version; the preview's pixels become that version's picture in the cache,
so it shows at once, everywhere, without a download. The hub takes a square PNG of 64
to 1024 pixels, re-encodes it at 128, and allows 6 changes an hour and 20 a day per
key.

**Showing.** Profiles and presence carry `avatar`, the picture's version (16 hex
digits of the SHA-256 of the hub's PNG), `""` for none. Pictures show on the profile
card, the Profile page, the in-game Players page's card of a player the hub knows on
the server, and the Staff page's chosen player. A screen asks the cache
([avatars.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/avatars.rs)) for a key's picture at a version
each frame it draws it; that compares a few strings and allocates nothing once asked.
The first ask hands the request to one worker thread (`sjk-avatars`), which reads the
picture kept on this PC or downloads `GET /v1/avatar/<key id>?v=<version>` (unsigned,
at most 256 KiB, a PNG), checks it is square, decodes it and cuts it round. Once a
frame, `avatars::service` takes what the worker finished and uploads at most four
pictures into the UI's icon atlas (two rows of 128-pixel cells: 31 pictures and the
preview). The cache holds 31; a new picture takes the place of the one shown longest
ago, never one drawn in the last two frames. A new version is a new picture. A picture
that could not be had is asked for again after two minutes, or at once when the hub's
address changes. Until a picture is there, and for a player without one, a stand-in
shows: the first letter of the name (past colour codes and symbols) on one of eight
colours picked from the key id, so a player has the same colour on every PC. A
verified player's picture is ringed in gold with the verified badge at its foot.

**Kept on this PC.** Downloaded pictures are kept as the hub served them in
`avatars/<key id>-<version>.png` beside `identity.key`
([avatars/store.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/avatars/store.rs)), so a picture is
downloaded once per version. The folder keeps at most 256 pictures and 8 MB: past
either, those used longest ago go (reading one counts as a use), and a key's older
versions go when a new one is kept. Only names of that exact form are read, written
or removed, so no text from the hub becomes a path. With the identity off nothing is
downloaded.

**Moderation.** Pictures are public and moderated by hand. A staff key's Staff page
has Take picture down for the chosen player (`/v1/staff/avatar-remove`, in the staff
log); stopping a key from uploading (`/v1/staff/avatar-block`,
`StaffRequest::AvatarBlock`) and the operator's commands are the hub's
(`ADMIN.md`). A picture taken down is gone: the key's `avatar` becomes `""` and
clients show the stand-in.

## Achievements

An achievement is a milestone of the player's own play. It grants nothing (saber
shaders for harder achievements are an idea for later, not built). The catalogue, in [achievements.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievements.rs)
and in the hub (same ids):

| Achievement | Id | Goal | Counted by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First Blood, Centurion, Legend of the Arena | `first_blood`, `kills_100`, `kills_1000` | 1, 100, 1000 players defeated | client |
| Blademaster | `saber_kills_100` | 100 players defeated with a saber | client |
| Rampage, Unstoppable | `streak_5`, `streak_10` | 5, 10 players defeated in one life | client |
| Unlimited Power | `dark_side_25` | 25 players defeated by Force lightning or drain | client |
| Watch Your Step | `ledge_10` | 10 players finished by a fall, a pit or a hazard after the player hit or pushed them | client |
| Arsenal | `arsenal` | players defeated with 8 kinds of weapon | client |
| Duelist, Duel Master | `duel_wins_10`, `duel_wins_100` | 10, 100 duels won | client |
| Flag Runner | `captures_10` | 10 flags captured | client |
| Traveller, Galaxy Tour | `maps_10`, `maps_25` | 10, 25 different maps played | client |
| Server Hopper | `servers_5` | 5 different servers played on | client |
| Regular, Veteran | `hours_10`, `hours_100` | 10, 100 hours played on servers | client |
| Storyteller | `storyteller` | a bio | hub |
| Bug Reporter | `bug_reporter` | a bug report the hub took | hub |
| Surveyor | `surveyor` | 5 world notes the hub took | hub |
| Decorated | `decorated` | a medal | hub |

What the client counts comes from its live matches on servers, never a demo or a game
it hosts ([tracker.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievements/tracker.rs), fed each
live snapshot by `achievements_frame.rs`):

- a kill is an obituary (`EV_OBITUARY`) whose attacker is the player's own client
  number (`GameState::client_num`, so watching someone else counts nothing) and whose
  victim is another player, not a teammate in a team game; its means of death says a
  saber, Force lightning or drain (`MOD_FORCE_DARK`), a fall or hazard (water, slime,
  lava, crush, falling, `trigger_hurt`: the game credits the player who pushed or hit
  the victim last), and the weapon kind for Arsenal (15 kinds);
- a streak counts kills since the player's own last death (or suicide), and the best
  one is kept;
- a duel is won by a kill of the opponent of the private duel the player state shows
  (`duelInProgress`, `duelIndex`, read the snapshot before too, as the duel ends with
  the kill), or any kill in a Duel or Power Duel game;
- captures are the player's own `persistant[PERS_CAPTURES]` rising (a rise of at most
  3 at once, with the same team; a team, map, server or slot change starts afresh);
- a map and a server count once the player is in the game there (not spectating, not
  following, not in the intermission), and time played is the time between such
  snapshots, at most a second at once.

The counts are kept in `achievements.json` beside `identity.key` (written at most
every 20 seconds while they change, through a temporary file, and on the way out),
so they work with the identity off. With it on, the identity service sends the
counts of the achievements the client counts to the hub (`PUT /v1/achievements`, a
signed request, at most once a minute, and again an hour later when the hub held
part back). The hub keeps each key's best count, up to the goal, and when it was
reached. Because the hub cannot see a match, it takes the counts as the player's own
record and bounds how fast each may rise (an hourly allowance per achievement: what
is over is taken in a later hour); a count the client keeps is never lower than the
hub's, so another PC or a reinstall takes the hub's counts back. Achievements the hub
counts itself come from what the key did there and no request can set them.

When the client sees one of its achievements reach its goal (in a match, or the hub's
count arriving), it writes "Achievement unlocked" to the console and shows its pop-up
([achievement_toast.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievement_toast.rs)): a card at the
top centre of the screen, clear of the crosshair, the chat and the HUD's corners, with
the board's medallion, "Achievement unlocked", the name, the category and what it
asked. It takes no input and pauses nothing, over play and over the menus alike. It
slides down and grows into place in under half a second while a gold ring sweeps
round the medallion, light bursts from it (a glow, a ring of light, sparks), its edge
flares and a glint crosses the card; it holds five seconds and fades out. Several
unlocks queue and show one after another. It waits while the console is open or the
medal pop-up shows. Each pop-up plays `sound/interface/secret_area.mp3`, the
single-player game's sound for a secret area found (its game module plays it with the
`@SP_INGAME_SECRET_AREA` centre print), which multiplayer installs have in the shared
`assets0.pk3`; `cg_achievementSound 0` (Settings > Sound > Achievement sound) leaves it
out. The board shows every
achievement in three columns: a medallion with the goal that fills with the count,
gold once unlocked, the name, the category (Combat, Duels and flags, Journeys,
Community), what to do, a bar and the count or the date it was unlocked.

What this proves: an achievement is the player's own record, as a claim is the
player's own word. A modified client or an edited `achievements.json` can send counts
nothing happened for; the hourly allowances only slow that down. Achievements a
dedicated server would vouch for are not built.

## Staff

Staff is a flag on a key, like verified, that only the hub operator sets; a player
cannot ask for it or set it. Profiles carry it, so anyone can see who is staff. A
staff key gets the SJK team's tools in the game: the Profile page shows Staff tools,
as does the SJK UI in-game menu's row of icons (and the `staff` command opens them; for
any other key it says they are for staff).

The Staff page ([staff_panel.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/staff_panel.rs), the SJK
UI's look) finds players (a name or part of one, colour codes ignored; a key id; or,
with Seen lately, the players the hub saw last), shows the chosen one (the player
themself until another is chosen, or with Me), and offers:

- every medal of the catalogue with what the player holds: Give (Give +1 for a
  repeatable one already held), Take back (one award; a repeatable one counts down),
  and a note sent with the next medal, which everyone can read;
- every unlockable of the catalogue with whether the player holds it (and since
  when): Unlock (`StaffRequest::Unlock`, with the note field's text as the team's
  note) and Relock (`StaffRequest::Relock`), as Give and Take back for medals; the
  hub's answer replaces the chosen profile and shows in the status line;
- the player's achievements at the hub, each with Clear, and Clear all, which waits
  for a second press within 3 seconds;
- the player's picture beside their name, with Take picture down
  ([Pictures](#pictures));
- the player's holocrons: the four tiers to choose and Give (`StaffRequest::HolocronGive`,
  with the note field's text as the team's note), and their four newest with Remove
  (`StaffRequest::HolocronRemove`) ([holocrons.md](holocrons.md#staff)).

Each action is a request signed by the staff member's own key (`PROTOCOL.md`,
"Staff"); the hub refuses it from a key that is not staff, keeps a log of every staff
action, and limits a staff key to 120 requests an hour. Staff cannot make staff,
verify keys or change names and bios.

Clearing achievements at the hub alone does not stick for the ones a client counts:
the player's game sends its counts again. So when staff members clear their own,
the client also forgets them (`achievements::forget`): the counter goes just below
the cleared achievement's goal, and every achievement on the same counter with a
higher goal is cleared with it (clearing First Blood clears Centurion and Legend of
the Arena, as the kill count goes to 0). The next kill, duel or map then unlocks it
again, which is how the unlock is tested. Clear all forgets every count on this PC.
Clearing another player's client-counted achievements only lasts until their game
sends its counts, which the page says.

## Settings and commands

- `cl_identity` (default 1; Settings > Network > SJK identity) turns the feature on.
- `cl_hubUrl` (default `https://sjk.dfox.app`; Settings > Network > SJK hub) is the hub's address.
  It must be `https://host[:port]` with no path; plain `http://` is accepted for
  localhost only.
- `profile` opens the Profile page (again: closes it), in the SJK UI the Profile
  screen's SJK Profile tab; `collection` opens the Collection, `achievements` on its
  Achievements tab and `unlockables` on its Shaders tab (in the SJK UI the Collection
  screen, [sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#collection)).
- `staff` opens the Staff page, for a staff key only.
- `sjkavatar <file>` reads a picture file and shows it on the Profile page, ready to
  send with Use this picture; `sjkavatar clear` takes the player's picture down;
  `sjkavatar` alone opens the picture panel ([Pictures](#pictures)).
- `cg_saberSkin` (archived, default empty) is the blade-skin unlock id the player
  wears; it applies, and is sent, only while the own profile lists it
  ([unlockables.md](unlockables.md)). `saberskin` lists the blade skins (owned or
  locked) and `saberskin <id>`/`none` sets it; `unlockables` opens the Collection's
  Shaders tab, where owned ones are equipped.
- `cl_sjkChat` (default 1; Settings > Network > SJK chat) shows the SJK chat and reads
  it; `sjkchat` opens its page, `messagemode5` (I) its composer in a game, and
  `sjkemote <id>` sends an emote ([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md)).
- `cg_achievementSound` (default 1; Settings > Sound > Achievement sound) plays the
  secret-area sound with each achievement's pop-up.
- `debug_medal <id|all> [x<count>] [note]` shows made-up medals in the new medal
  pop-up, sending nothing ([Medals](#medals)).
- `debug_holocron <tier|all> [x<count>]` shows made-up holocrons in the drop pop-up,
  sending nothing ([holocrons.md](holocrons.md#debug_holocron)).
- The Identity page (Settings > Network > SJK identity key, main menu > SJK > IDENTITY
  in the classic menus, the in-game SJK menu, or the `identity` command) shows what the
  hub knows: the name worn now and up to three earlier ones, whether the key is
  verified, the key id and the key file's location and the players the hub knows here.
  The key id and the file (whose path names the Windows account) are bullets and
  "(hidden)" until Show key is pressed, every time the page opens (not saved), so a
  player can open it on a stream (09/10/2026, Sol's request). Elsewhere the player's
  own key id is never printed: not on the Profile page, nor on their own row of the
  Players cards, their own sender card or the SJK chat page's side panel for their own
  message (`player_identity::printable_key_id`); other players' key ids still show. Its controls are
  optional: the on/off switch, a bio field with Save, a button that copies the key id
  (to the clipboard, never on screen), Show key. The words do the same without it: `identity bio <text>` sets the bio,
  `identity key` shows the key id and file, `identity who [slot]` lists the players the hub
  knows here (with a slot, their bio). `identity name` explains that the name is the one
  played under (`/name`).

## The key file

`identity.key` holds the private key as two lines (`SJK-IDENTITY-1` and the base64url
seed). It is created once and never overwritten; a damaged file is reported and
left alone, and the feature stays off until it is restored, because replacing it
would silently end that identity. The player must back it up: it cannot be
recovered, and copying it to another PC makes that PC the same identity. On Unix it
is created readable by its owner only; on Windows it relies on the folder's default
permissions.

## Planned, not built

The hub is meant to grow: music and video. None of that exists. The SJK chat and the
emotes path ([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md)) and the asset packs ([Asset packs](#asset-packs))
are built. In the SJK UI the Identity page opens from the Profile
page (its arc holds five entries), the in-game SJK menu and the `identity` command.
Achievements a dedicated server would vouch for, and pictures for the achievements,
are not made yet.
