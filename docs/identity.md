# Player identity and the SJK hub

SJK players can be recognised across servers without accounts or passwords. Each
install keeps an Ed25519 key; a small web service, the SJK hub, maps public keys to
the in-game names they have worn, an optional bio and a "verified" flag its operator
sets; and while a player is on a game server, their client tells the hub which slot
they are in, so other SJK clients can mark that player on the scoreboard and put a
gold verified badge after a verified player's nameplate. A player does nothing: the
key is made, registered and kept up to date on its own, under the name they play
with. The game works without the hub; the badges and profiles are an extra.

This page is the design and the current limits. The player-facing summary is
[client.md](client.md#identity).

| The hub itself and its protocol | repository Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub (`PROTOCOL.md`) |

The hub is a separate repository because it is deployed on its own schedule. The
client and hub each carry the protocol types; `PROTOCOL.md` has a signed-request test
vector that both test suites check, so a drift in either shows as a failing test.

## What happens

1. With `cl_identity` on (the default), the first start creates `identity.key` in
   the settings folder beside `config.cfg`. With it off, no key is made.
2. With `cl_hubUrl` set, a worker thread registers the key at the hub (a request
   signed by the key, which proves the client holds it) with the in-game name the
   player wears (the `name` setting), and fetches its profile. When the name changes
   it registers again with the new one. The hub keeps each key's worn names (20 most
   recent, with when it first and last saw each), and a profile's name is the one
   worn last unless the operator gave the key another. Nobody chooses a hub name, so
   two keys may wear one name: the name proves nothing, the key does.
3. While the client is in a live, non-local session, the thread repeats a *claim*
   every 45 seconds: "this key is in slot N of server S, shown as NAME". Claims
   live 90 seconds at the hub and are withdrawn when the player leaves or quits.
4. The thread reads the hub's list of claims for the server every 15 seconds. The
   scoreboard marks a row with SJK's emblem, in gold when verified, the player card
   shows the hub name, and a verified player's nameplate gets a gold badge after the
   name (`ui_renderer/verified_badge.rs`, read once a second), when a claim names
   that slot and its claimed name matches the name the game shows there (compared
   after lower-casing and dropping colour codes and symbols). The local player's own
   plate (`cg_nameplateSelf`) has the badge when their own key is verified.

Verification is the operator's alone (the hub's `verify` command or its operator API,
which list every key with its worn names); a player asks for nothing and sets nothing.

Nothing blocks a frame: the viewer compares settings and place with what the thread
was last told twice a second, and the scoreboard re-derives its marks only when the
hub's roster or its own rows change. While registered, the thread also reads the
player's own profile again every ten minutes, so the verified flag and medals the SJK
team changes reach a running client.

## What a badge proves

A badge says "a registered SJK key claimed this slot under this name". It does not
prove the player in that slot holds the key, because stock and JA+/JoF servers
publish only fixed fields of a player's userinfo to other clients (SJK's own server
does the same, `bridge_userinfo.rs`), so nothing in-band can carry a proof. The
hub limits the damage: a claim fails while another key holds the same slot under
the same name, display names that normalise to another's are refused, and the claimed
name must match what the game shows. The worst a false claim does is label someone
else's slot with the claimant's own profile; it cannot take another key's name or
verified flag. Badges are for recognition, not for granting anything.

A confirmed tier (SJK's own server adding a hub-signed ticket to the player string)
is planned, not implemented.

## Privacy

With `cl_identity` on and `cl_hubUrl` set the hub receives the player's public key
and in-game name at start and whenever the name changes, the game server address,
slot and in-game name for as long as they play, and sees their IP address. Claims
are deleted 90 seconds after they stop being repeated; profiles and the worn-name
history stay until the operator removes them. With either setting off the client
sends nothing. Since 06/10/2026 `cl_hubUrl` defaults to `https://sjk.dfox.app` so players
set nothing: a default install makes a key and tells that hub where it plays. The
Identity page, the setting's help and the changelog say what is sent and that
`cl_identity 0` stops it.

A bug report (Escape, SJK, Report a bug) is sent only when the player presses Enter
on it: its text, the map, the client build, the game server's address and the in-game
name the player wears, signed with the player's key. The hub keeps it until the operator removes it.

A player report (Escape, Players, or Escape, SJK, Report a player) is sent only by a
verified player who chooses a player and a reason and presses Send: the reason and its few
words, the reported player's slot and the name the game shows for them, the key the hub's
presence list shows in that slot (if any), the server's address and name, the map, the
build, the match clock and the in-game name the reporter wears, signed with the reporter's
key. The hub keeps it until the operator removes it.

A world note (`inspect` twice on the world, [client.md](client.md#player-card)) is sent
only when the player sends it, with `cl_identity` on: its text, the map, the build, the
game server's address, the in-game name the player wears, where the player stood (`setviewpos`), the aimed point, shader,
surface and entity, and a smaller copy of its screenshot (at most 1280 x 720), signed
with the player's key. The note dialog says so. The hub keeps it until the operator
removes it; the full note and screenshot stay on the player's PC either way.

## Bug reports

[bug_report.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/bug_report.rs) and
[report.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/report.rs). While the game menu is open, a Report a
bug button sits centred at the bottom of the screen (also Escape, SJK, Report a bug); it
closes the game menu and opens the text dialog
([text_dialog.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/text_dialog.rs)): a panel in the middle of the
screen with a text box, a character count, Send and Cancel (Escape cancels too). As it is
typed or pasted, only letters and digits of any
script, spaces and `. , ! ? ' - : ( )` are kept (line breaks become spaces), up to 600
characters. Enter or Send checks the hub's rules (a refusal is shown in the panel, which
stays open) (10 to 600 characters, a few real words, no
long run of one character) and hands the report to the identity service, which sends
`POST /v1/report` signed with the player's key; the outcome (the hub's report number,
or why it refused, for example a quota) shows on the SJK UI's card, which waits for it
([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs)), else as a centre print. The report carries the
in-game name the player wears (the service fills it from the `name` it already sends the
hub); the hub keeps it with the report and adds it to the key's worn names. The hub checks
everything again and limits reports per key (3 a day, 20 once verified, 5 an hour, no
repeat within a day), per address (3 in 10 minutes) and overall (300 a day, 5000 kept),
so a troll with fresh keys gets little through and nothing that is not plain words. The
operator reads them with the hub's `reports` command or `/admin/v1/reports`.

## Player reports

[players.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/ingame_menu/players.rs) and
[player_report.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/player_report.rs). The game menu's Players page
is a small scoreboard of everyone on the server: each connected client's name, side, score
and ping (the client asks the server for scores every two seconds while it shows) and what
the hub knows of them (an SJK player, or a verified one, from the presence list), sixteen a
page with More players... and Back under them. The SJK UI draws it as a table with the
chosen player's card on the right (main page > Players); the classic menus list it in the
SJK pop-up's Report a player. Enter on a player opens the Report page: seven
reasons (cheating, harassment or hate, griefing, exploiting a bug, an offensive name, spam
or advertising, something else) and Back. A reason closes the menu and opens the text
dialog for a few words (10 to 300 characters, the bug reports' alphabet and noise rules);
Send hands the report to the identity service, which sends `POST /v1/player-report`
signed with the player's key, and the outcome (the hub's number, or why it refused) shows
on the SJK UI's card, else as a centre print. The player is copied when chosen, so the
report names them as they were.

Only a verified SJK player may report (`player_identity::report_gate`): with the identity
off, the hub not answering yet, an unverified key or a game on this PC, the Players page
says why under its title (the classic pages in their first line), and the Report
page's reasons are dimmed, Back carrying the reason; yourself and bots cannot be reported
either. The service refuses an unverified key before anything is sent, and the hub checks
everything again: verified keys only, a live claim of the reporter on that server, nobody
reports themselves, 3 an hour and 10 a day per key, one report per key about one player a
day (the same server and name, or the same key), 20 a day about one player from everyone,
3 in 10 minutes per address, 300 a day and 5000 kept overall. The hub names the reported key
from its own live claim on that slot when the names match, else takes the client's. The
operator reads them with the hub's `player-reports` command or `/admin/v1/player-reports`
(also by reported key) and decides what to do.

## World notes

[world_notes.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/world_notes.rs). A world note
([client.md](client.md#player-card)) is kept on the player's PC as before and, with the
identity on, also goes to the hub for the SJK team. The note dialog keeps the bug
reports' alphabet as it is typed, and Send checks the hub's note rules (3 to 500
characters, at least 2 letters, no long run of one character). The identity service
sends `POST /v1/note` with the text and the selection: map, build, server, `view` (the
`setviewpos` x, y, z and yaw), the aimed point and normal, shader, BSP surface,
lighting, distance and the entity's class name (a name outside the hub's alphabet is
left out rather than the note refused), and the in-game name the player wears, as for a
report. The hub answers with the note's number, which a
centre print and the console show, or why it refused. The screenshot writer also makes a
smaller JPEG of the same pixels (`capture::preview_jpeg`: fitted within 1280 x 720,
quality lowered until under 380 KiB) and hands it to the service, which sends it with
`PUT /v1/note/<id>/image` once the hub took the note; a picture that fails leaves the
note as it is. The hub limits notes per key (20 a day, 200 once verified, 30 an hour, no
repeat of the same text about the same shader within a day), per address (40 notes and
pictures in 10 minutes) and overall (1000 a day, 3000 kept), and takes a picture only
from the note's sender, once, within 10 minutes. The operator lists notes with their
pictures with the hub's `notes` command or `/admin/v1/notes`.

With the classic menus (`ui_menuStyle classic`) the dialog and the button take the
classic+ look ([text_dialog_classic.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/text_dialog_classic.rs),
[classic-plus.md](classic-plus.md#pages)): the in-game pop-up box with its title band,
the text in a retail list box, gold Send and Cancel, the description line under the box,
and a gold REPORT A BUG on retail's red band at the bottom of the canvas. With the SJK UI
the dialog is its pop-up card and there is no button (Report a bug is on the in-game
menu's SJK page): [sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#report-a-bug-and-its-dialogs).

## Medals

A medal is recognition the SJK team gives a player by hand: for testing SJK early,
contributing to its code, finding bugs, or belonging to the JoF clan. A medal grants
nothing: no setting, cosmetic, power or right comes with it, on any server. Players do
not ask for medals or choose them; the SJK team gives them.

| Medal | Id | For | Given again |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Early Tester | `early_tester` | Helped test SJK in its early days. | no |
| Early Contributor | `early_contributor` | Contributed to SJK's code in its early days. | no |
| Bug Hunter | `bug_hunter` | Found bugs that got fixed. | yes, with a count ("Bug Hunter x2") |
| JoF Clan | `jof_clan` | A member of the JoF clan. | no |

The hub lists a key's medals in its profile (`"medals":[{"id","count","awarded","note"}]`:
the count, when it was last given and a short note from the team, often empty) and in its
presence entry (`id` and `count` only), so the scoreboard needs no request per player.
Lists come in the table's order; a client shows only the ids it knows and older hubs
send none. The catalogue is [medals.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medals.rs): each medal's
name, description, ribbon colours and two pictures in `assets/medals` (`<id>.png`, the
whole medal on its ribbon, 512 square; `<id>_small.png`, the medallion alone, 128
square, for anything under about 64 pixels). A new medal is one entry there and two
pictures; new art is a file replacement. The JoF Clan picture is provisional.

Where they show:

- The scoreboard, every style: up to three small ribbon bars after the SJK emblem, on
  rows whose claim the emblem trusts (the claimed name matches the name the game shows).
  They are coloured rectangles drawn from the catalogue (Early Tester amber with black
  stripes, Early Contributor navy with a white centre stripe, Bug Hunter emerald and JoF
  Clan crimson with black edges), sized after the emblem; they take room from the name,
  never the columns, and fewer show where the name would keep less than half its room
  (the SJK UI: a third). Derived only when the roster or the rows change.
- The player card (`inspect`): the medallions in a row under the hub name; a pinned card
  names them too, with a repeatable one's count.
- The SJK UI's Players page: the chosen player's card lists their medallions and names.
- The Identity page: the player's own medals, each with its whole picture, name and
  count, description, the date it was given (`dd/mm/yyyy`) and the team's note; with
  none, a line saying the SJK team gives medals for testing, contributing and more.
- The new medal pop-up ([medal_popup.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medal_popup.rs)): the
  first time the client sees a medal in the player's own profile, or a repeatable one's
  count rise, it shows it once, large, with its name, description, date and note;
  Enter, Escape, Space or a click closes it, and several show one after another. It
  opens on the main menu, or when the game menu opens in a match, never over play: a
  medal that arrives during a match is announced once by a centre print pointing to the
  game menu. While it shows, the menu under it is neither drawn nor given input. What was
  shown is kept in `medals_seen.txt` beside `identity.key` (the key id, then one
  `<id> <count>` a line; ids the build does not know are kept), so each medal and each
  new count shows once per identity, and an install that already held medals when it
  first read its profile still shows them.
- The credits page's cards: not from the hub but from credits.txt's `medal:` lines,
  which use the same ids (Creyon and Lumaya wear Early Contributor), so a contributor's
  card shows its medals without a request; the SJK UI draws each whole with its name
  and description beside the card's lines, the other looks as chips (medallion and
  name) after the counts ([client.md](client.md#credits-page)).
- Not on nameplates.

Medals are public: anyone can read a key's profile and the presence list of a server,
so a player's medals, counts, dates and notes are visible to everyone, as their hub
name and verified flag are. The client sends nothing about medals.

## Profile

The Profile page (the SJK UI's main page > SJK > Profile, the classic menu's SJK
page, the in-game SJK menu, or the `profile` command) is the player's SJK profile
as other players read it on the hub, in the SJK UI's look in every menu style:

- who they are: the hub name with its colours, Verified by the SJK team or not yet,
  the date the key was registered (`Member since`), the key id and up to three other
  names worn; Identity settings opens the Identity page (the switch, the key, the hub);
- their record, from the achievement counts kept on this PC (players defeated, saber
  kills, best streak, duels won, flags captured, maps and servers played, time
  played) and the last four achievements unlocked;
- the bio, written in a box of up to 6 lines (Enter saves, Shift+Enter starts a new
  line, Revert puts back the hub's copy), with its counts, the hub's answer and the
  rules in a line under it;
- their medals (picture, name, date given) and how many achievements are unlocked,
  with a way to the board.

Its second tab is the achievements board (below; the `achievements` command opens
it). With the identity off, or the hub out of reach, the page says so: the bio cannot
be written and the record and board show this PC's counts.

### The bio's rules

A bio is free text every player can read, so it keeps to what SJK's fonts draw and
to nothing that hides, reorders or piles characters up. Before it is checked, line
ends become `\n`, each line's runs of spaces and tabs become one space and its ends
are trimmed, and runs of blank lines become one. Then it must hold at most 500
characters, at most 6 lines, no run of one character longer than 8, and only Latin
letters (with their accented and extended forms, Vietnamese included) and Cyrillic
ones, ASCII digits, the space, newlines, ``. , ! ? ' " - : ; ( ) [ ] & / + # @ % * _ =
~ < > | $`` and colour codes (`^` and a digit). That refuses emoji, symbols, combining
marks (no piled-up "Zalgo" text), zero-width and direction-changing characters, other
spaces, private-use and unassigned code points and control characters.

[bio.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/bio.rs) holds the rules, and the hub's copy is the
same code. They are applied three times: the bio box (and the Identity page's field)
cannot type what a bio cannot hold; the client checks the whole bio before sending it
and says which rule it breaks; the hub refuses a bio that breaks one (`bio_length`,
`bio_characters`, `bio_lines`, `bio_noise`). And whatever a hub sends back, the
client shows a bio only through `bio::for_display`, which drops what the rules
refuse, so a bio stored before the rules, or a foreign hub, cannot put anything else
on screen. A bio is plain text: nothing in it is ever a link or markup.

## Achievements

An achievement is a milestone of the player's own play. Like a medal it grants
nothing. The catalogue, in [achievements.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievements.rs)
and in the hub (same ids):

| Achievement | Id | Goal | Counted by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| First Blood, Centurion, Legend of the Arena | `first_blood`, `kills_100`, `kills_1000` | 1, 100, 1000 players defeated | client |
| Blademaster | `saber_kills_100` | 100 players defeated with a saber | client |
| Rampage, Unstoppable | `streak_5`, `streak_10` | 5, 10 players defeated in one life | client |
| Unlimited Power | `dark_side_25` | 25 players defeated by Force lightning or drain | client |
| Watch Your Step | `ledge_10` | 10 players finished by a fall, a pit or a hazard after the player hit or pushed them | client |
| Arsenal | `arsenal` | players defeated with 8 kinds of weapon | client |
| Duelist, Duel Master | `duel_wins_10`, `duel_wins_100` | 10, 100 duels won | client |
| Flag Runner | `captures_10` | 10 flags captured | client |
| Traveller, Galaxy Tour | `maps_10`, `maps_25` | 10, 25 different maps played | client |
| Server Hopper | `servers_5` | 5 different servers played on | client |
| Regular, Veteran | `hours_10`, `hours_100` | 10, 100 hours played on servers | client |
| Storyteller | `storyteller` | a bio | hub |
| Bug Reporter | `bug_reporter` | a bug report the hub took | hub |
| Surveyor | `surveyor` | 5 world notes the hub took | hub |
| Decorated | `decorated` | a medal | hub |

What the client counts comes from its live matches on servers, never a demo or a game
it hosts ([tracker.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievements/tracker.rs), fed each
live snapshot by `achievements_frame.rs`):

- a kill is an obituary (`EV_OBITUARY`) whose attacker is the player's own client
  number (`GameState::client_num`, so watching someone else counts nothing) and whose
  victim is another player, not a teammate in a team game; its means of death says a
  saber, Force lightning or drain (`MOD_FORCE_DARK`), a fall or hazard (water, slime,
  lava, crush, falling, `trigger_hurt`: the game credits the player who pushed or hit
  the victim last), and the weapon kind for Arsenal (15 kinds);
- a streak counts kills since the player's own last death (or suicide), and the best
  one is kept;
- a duel is won by a kill of the opponent of the private duel the player state shows
  (`duelInProgress`, `duelIndex`, read the snapshot before too, as the duel ends with
  the kill), or any kill in a Duel or Power Duel game;
- captures are the player's own `persistant[PERS_CAPTURES]` rising (a rise of at most
  3 at once, with the same team; a team, map, server or slot change starts afresh);
- a map and a server count once the player is in the game there (not spectating, not
  following, not in the intermission), and time played is the time between such
  snapshots, at most a second at once.

The counts are kept in `achievements.json` beside `identity.key` (written at most
every 20 seconds while they change, through a temporary file, and on the way out),
so they work with the identity off. With it on, the identity service sends the
counts of the achievements the client counts to the hub (`PUT /v1/achievements`, a
signed request, at most once a minute, and again an hour later when the hub held
part back). The hub keeps each key's best count, up to the goal, and when it was
reached. Because the hub cannot see a match, it takes the counts as the player's own
record and bounds how fast each may rise (an hourly allowance per achievement: what
is over is taken in a later hour); a count the client keeps is never lower than the
hub's, so another PC or a reinstall takes the hub's counts back. Achievements the hub
counts itself come from what the key did there and no request can set them.

When the client sees one of its achievements reach its goal (in a match, or the hub's
count arriving), it writes "Achievement unlocked" to the console and shows its pop-up
([achievement_toast.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/achievement_toast.rs)): a card at the
top centre of the screen, clear of the crosshair, the chat and the HUD's corners, with
the board's medallion, "Achievement unlocked", the name, the category and what it
asked. It takes no input and pauses nothing, over play and over the menus alike. It
slides down and grows into place in under half a second while a gold ring sweeps
round the medallion, light bursts from it (a glow, a ring of light, sparks), its edge
flares and a glint crosses the card; it holds five seconds and fades out. Several
unlocks queue and show one after another. It waits while the console is open or the
medal pop-up shows. Each pop-up plays `sound/interface/secret_area.mp3`, the
single-player game's sound for a secret area found (its game module plays it with the
`@SP_INGAME_SECRET_AREA` centre print), which multiplayer installs have in the shared
`assets0.pk3`; `cg_achievementSound 0` (Settings > Sound > Achievement sound) leaves it
out. The board shows every
achievement in three columns: a medallion with the goal that fills with the count,
gold once unlocked, the name, the category (Combat, Duels and flags, Journeys,
Community), what to do, a bar and the count or the date it was unlocked.

What this proves: an achievement is the player's own record, as a claim is the
player's own word. A modified client or an edited `achievements.json` can send counts
nothing happened for; the hourly allowances only slow that down. Achievements a
dedicated server would vouch for are not built.

## Staff

Staff is a flag on a key, like verified, that only the hub operator sets; a player
cannot ask for it or set it. Profiles carry it, so anyone can see who is staff. A
staff key gets the SJK team's tools in the game: the Profile page shows Staff tools
(and the `staff` command opens them; for any other key it says they are for staff).

The Staff page ([staff_panel.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/staff_panel.rs), the SJK
UI's look) finds players (a name or part of one, colour codes ignored; a key id; or,
with Seen lately, the players the hub saw last), shows the chosen one (the player
themself until another is chosen, or with Me), and offers:

- every medal of the catalogue with what the player holds: Give (Give +1 for a
  repeatable one already held), Take back (one award; a repeatable one counts down),
  and a note sent with the next medal, which everyone can read;
- the player's achievements at the hub, each with Clear, and Clear all, which waits
  for a second press within 3 seconds.

Each action is a request signed by the staff member's own key (`PROTOCOL.md`,
"Staff"); the hub refuses it from a key that is not staff, keeps a log of every staff
action, and limits a staff key to 120 requests an hour. Staff cannot make staff,
verify keys or change names and bios.

Clearing achievements at the hub alone does not stick for the ones a client counts:
the player's game sends its counts again. So when staff members clear their own,
the client also forgets them (`achievements::forget`): the counter goes just below
the cleared achievement's goal, and every achievement on the same counter with a
higher goal is cleared with it (clearing First Blood clears Centurion and Legend of
the Arena, as the kill count goes to 0). The next kill, duel or map then unlocks it
again, which is how the unlock is tested. Clear all forgets every count on this PC.
Clearing another player's client-counted achievements only lasts until their game
sends its counts, which the page says.

## Settings and commands

- `cl_identity` (default 1; Settings > Network > SJK identity) turns the feature on.
- `cl_hubUrl` (default `https://sjk.dfox.app`; Settings > Network > SJK hub) is the hub's address.
  It must be `https://host[:port]` with no path; plain `http://` is accepted for
  localhost only.
- `profile` opens the Profile page and `achievements` its board (again: closes it).
- `staff` opens the Staff page, for a staff key only.
- `cg_achievementSound` (default 1; Settings > Sound > Achievement sound) plays the
  secret-area sound with each achievement's pop-up.
- The Identity page (main menu > SJK > IDENTITY, the Profile page's Identity settings,
  the in-game SJK menu, or the `identity` command) shows what the hub knows: the name worn now and up to three earlier ones,
  whether the key is verified, the key file's location and the players the hub knows here.
  Its controls are optional: the on/off switch, a bio field with Save, a button that copies
  the key id. The words do the same without it: `identity bio <text>` sets the bio,
  `identity key` shows the key id and file, `identity who [slot]` lists the players the hub
  knows here (with a slot, their bio). `identity name` explains that the name is the one
  played under (`/name`).

## The key file

`identity.key` holds the private key as two lines (`SJK-IDENTITY-1` and the base64url
seed). It is created once and never overwritten; a damaged file is reported and
left alone, and the feature stays off until it is restored, because replacing it
would silently end that identity. The player must back it up: it cannot be
recovered, and copying it to another PC makes that PC the same identity. On Unix it
is created readable by its owner only; on Windows it relies on the folder's default
permissions.

## Planned, not built

The hub is meant to grow: a signed asset manifest, music and video, and private
chat. None of that exists. In the SJK UI the Identity page opens from the Profile
page (its arc holds five entries), the in-game SJK menu and the `identity` command.
Achievements a dedicated server would vouch for, and pictures for the achievements,
are not made yet.
