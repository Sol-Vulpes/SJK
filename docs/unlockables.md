# Unlockables and looks

Unlockables are cosmetic things an SJK player owns at the hub (`cl_hubUrl`,
sjk.dfox.app): saber blade skins with their own look and sounds, the **Sun**,
**Storm**, **Void**, **Frost** and **Prism** blades. Their art is SJK's own and not in
this repository: the hub delivers it
to SJK clients in packs ([Packs](#packs)), and the client draws it with open, generic
code from data ([Blade-skin files](#blade-skin-files)). A player's *look* (the blade skin they wear and whether their
Illuminate holocron is lit) travels through the hub, so every SJK player on the
same game server sees it. Players on stock clients see nothing, and no game
server knows of any of it.

Status (08/10/2026): designed with Sol the same day and built on
`personal/saber-skins` (client, stacked on `personal/sjk-chat`) and
`feat/unlocks-looks` (Sol-Vulpes/SJK-hub, stacked on `feat/chat-emotes`). The
hub's side is not deployed, so nothing has been seen with real players yet. Each
section below says what is built and how it was verified.

09/10/2026, branch `feat/more-blade-skins` (stacked on `personal/blade-skins`, with the
hub's `feat/more-blade-skins`): a skinned blade's tip is round instead of square
([Blade skins](#blade-skins)); the generic shading gained lightning arcs, drifting motes
and a turning hue, and the catalogue the Storm, Void, Frost and Prism blades. Checked
by unit tests and a CPU copy of the shader's maths rendered to images; not yet seen on a
GPU or heard.

10/10/2026, branch `personal/saber-shaders` (with the hub's `feat/saber-shaders`): nine
more saber shaders (Unstable, Molten, Spectral, Glitch, Hologram, Runic, Chameleon,
Banner, Heartbeat) and the generic sections they use ([Blade-skin
files](#blade-skin-files), [rendering.md](rendering.md#saber-blade-skins)); up to 16
skins load at once. The Collection's rack and the Saber tab's blade row scroll, as
fifteen choices no longer fit. Seen in off-screen GPU renders on duel6 (world shot
`duel6_second_blades`); not in a live match, not heard.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
| --- | --- |
| Who sees a look | Every SJK player on the same game server, through the hub. |
| Who may wear an unlockable | Only a key the hub lists it for. The hub refuses to relay a look whose blade skin the key does not own (`not_unlocked`). |
| How one is unlocked | The hub operator or staff grant it by hand (Staff page, operator command), and since 10/10/2026 a medal brings one while held: Bug Hunter the Glitch, Early Tester the Hologram, Early Contributor the Runic blade ([Medal shaders](#medal-shaders)). Achievements granting them are an idea for later, with harder goals than today's; holocrons dropping them are parked until Sol decides the pool and odds. |
| How a look travels | Stored on the key's live claim, listed in presence for players who arrive later, and sent through the feed as a live event when it changes. |
| Illuminate | Free for everyone, a toy (`toy_illuminate`); its lit state is part of the look so others see the holocron. |
| Feed with chat off | The feed reads while the player is on a game server whatever `cl_sjkChat` says (chat stays hidden); in the menus it reads only with chat on. |
| Choosing | The Collection's Shaders tab (SJK UI look; the Unlockables page until 10/10/2026) lists every blade skin, owned or locked, previews the chosen one on the player's own saber and equips owned ones; the Profile screen's Saber tab offers the owned blade skins too (10/10/2026); `cg_saberSkin` holds the choice. |
| Art (looks, sounds) | SJK's own, all rights reserved, not under the code's GPLv2: kept in the hub's private repository and served by the hub to registered SJK keys as packs. The code that draws it stays open and generic: no skin's values, sounds or pictures are in this repository or its history to come. |
| Delivery | The identity service downloads the hub's packs into `assets/` beside `identity.key` (at start once registered, then every 6 hours, only when a pack's SHA-256 changed); the viewer mounts every cached pack at start and a new one at once, below the game data, so a PK3 with the same paths replaces their files. A cached pack mounts with the identity off too. |
| Tiers | Every saber shader has a tier, the holocrons' four (Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, Mythical), their names and colours (10/10/2026, Sol's tiers; [Tiers](#tiers)). Uncommon is for plainer shaders to come (colours, no effects). |
| Format | A blade skin is a JSON file, `skins/blades/<unlock id>.bladeskin`, holding every parameter of the generic shading, its trail, light and sound paths. The format is documented here; the files are art. |

## Catalogue

Fixed, in the hub (`src/unlocks.rs`) and in the client
([unlockables.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/unlockables.rs), the one client list of
public metadata: id, name, kind, a line on what it is and how to get it; the looks, the
blade skins, `saberskin`, the Collection and the Staff page all read it); a new
unlockable needs both, and a blade skin also its file in a pack. Ids never change
meaning.

| Id | Name | Kind | How to get it |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `saber_sun` | Sun blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_storm` | Storm blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_void` | Void blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_frost` | Frost blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_prism` | Prism blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_unstable` | Unstable blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_molten` | Molten blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_spectral` | Spectral blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_glitch` | Glitch blade | blade skin | Comes with the Bug Hunter medal, for as long as you hold it. |
| `saber_hologram` | Hologram blade | blade skin | Comes with the Early Tester medal, for as long as you hold it. |
| `saber_runic` | Runic blade | blade skin | Comes with the Early Contributor medal, for as long as you hold it. |
| `saber_chameleon` | Chameleon blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_banner` | Banner blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |
| `saber_heartbeat` | Heartbeat blade | blade skin | Given by the SJK team. |

A client ignores an id it does not know. Both catalogues' tests pin this exact list
(ids, names, order), so a change to one fails until the other follows.

What each looks and sounds like, in words (the values and the sounds themselves are
the hub's, described in its `scripts/blade_skin_sounds.py` and `saber_skin_sounds.py`):

- **Sun**: a white-gold core in an orange corona graded from red at its rim to gold
  inside, granules drifting along it, tall flame tongues licking out of its edge and
  bright flares running from the hilt to the tip; since 11/10/2026 prominences (thick,
  smooth gold loops slowly leaving the blade and falling back), rising sparks, and, for
  the clients that read the additions file, a four-ray glint turning at the tip and heat
  haze bending what is behind the blade ([Options](#options): each can be switched
  off); a warm flickering light; a solar roar.
- **Storm**: a white-blue core in a violet-to-electric-blue corona that crackles; a few
  thin, jagged white-blue lightning arcs at a time, struck again and again at random
  places, leaving the blade, bulging out to one side and coming back further along,
  crawling toward the tip and re-shaping as they fade; some leap from the tip into the
  air instead; white sparks spray from round the tip; a fast-flickering light; an
  electric buzz with sizzle and crackle.
- **Void**: a hollow blade: the inside of its glow is black (nothing is added there, so
  the world shows through), its rim violet, with a faint deep-violet line for a core
  and a dark round mouth at the tip; slow tendrils licking inward and rare slow magenta
  surges; pale star specks drift in from outside and fade as they reach it; a low,
  slowly beating drone.
- **Frost**: a pale ice-white core ending in a long pointed icicle tip, in an icy blue
  corona with a soft cold haze; faint crystalline veins by the core that re-form now
  and then; thin frost shards glinting as they trail toward the hilt and round the tip;
  a soft hum under shimmering bell tones and tiny ice tinkles.
- **Prism**: a white core whose fringe and corona run through the rainbow along the
  blade, the spectrum sliding slowly with time and the rim a different hue from the
  inside (refraction bands), sharp bright bands drifting along it and coloured
  sparkles; its light turns through the colours with the blade's middle; a chord in
  detuned voices under a slowly sweeping resonance.
- **Unstable**: a raw red blade whose glow's edge is frayed by fast noise and whose
  length now and then falters (cut short for an instant), sparks spitting off it, a
  hard-flickering light; a torn, stuttering buzz under dense crackle.
- **Molten**: a dim, dark-red core split by bright orange lava cracks (veins) running
  through the core and the inside of the glow, embers dripping off it and falling as
  gravity pulls them, whichever way the blade is held; a bubbling, sizzling rumble.
- **Spectral**: a pale, see-through blue-white blade with a wide soft glow and faint
  wisps; swinging, it leaves up to four fading afterimages of its glow where it was;
  since 11/10/2026 its outline wavers like smoke, souls (soft lights) drift slowly round
  it, its rim turns pale violet, its light is dimmer and colder and, for the clients
  that read the additions file, wisps of smoke rise off it (a sheet over a blade held
  level, a plume over the tip of one held upright) and an echo of it sways beside it,
  even held still ([Options](#options): each can be switched off); an airy pad under a
  whisper, with echoes.
- **Glitch**: a teal blade whose red and blue part from its green; on random draws
  blocks of it jump sideways and flash, now and then the whole blade; a gated buzz with
  digital blips.
- **Hologram**: a hollow blue projection drawn as a wireframe (two side lines and rings
  round the blade) with scan lines running along it, jittering sideways now and then;
  a clean tone, a projector whine and a scan tick.
- **Runic**: a dim gold core with glyphs scrolling toward the tip that spell its
  wearer's name (SJK's own stroke glyphs, one per letter); a chord of fifths with bell
  glints.
- **Chameleon**: a pale blade that takes the colour of the light where it is (the map's
  light grid, saturation raised), so it changes from place to place and map to map; a
  body whose resonance slowly morphs.
- **Banner**: its wearer's team colour in team games (red, blue), silver outside a team,
  rippling like a flag; a warm buzz and fluttering cloth.
- **Heartbeat**: a warm crimson blade that beats with a slow double heartbeat (lub-dub,
  once a second), brightening and swelling with each beat, its light beating with it;
  a drone with a heartbeat.

## Hub protocol (additions to version 1)

Old clients ignore all of it, so it stays `/v1/`. The hub's `PROTOCOL.md` gains an
"Unlocks" and a "Looks" section with exactly this.

### Unlocks

- Profile gains `"unlocks":[{"id":"saber_sun","granted":<unix s>,"note":".."}]`, in
  the catalogue's order; `note` is 0 to 200 characters of plain text from the team,
  often empty. Absent from older hubs.
- A key holds each unlock at most once. Only the operator (`unlock <key_id> <id>
  [note]` and `relock <key_id> <id>` commands, and the operator API beside medals)
  and staff can grant or take one back:
  - `POST /v1/staff/unlock` (signed, staff) `{"key_id":"..","unlock":"..","note":".."}`
    answers the target's Profile. An unknown id is 400 `bad_unlock`, a key already
    holding it 409 `already_unlocked`, an unknown key 404 `not_found`.
  - `POST /v1/staff/relock` (signed, staff) `{"key_id":"..","unlock":".."}` answers the
    Profile; a key not holding it is 404 `not_unlocked`.
  - Both are written to the staff log and count against the staff limits.
- Taking a blade skin back clears it from that key's live looks at once (and sends a
  look event, below), so it disappears for everyone.
- Removing an identity removes its unlocks.

### Looks

A look is what a player wears that others draw:

    {"saber":"saber_sun","illuminate":true}

Since 11/10/2026 a look may also carry `"saber_off":["glint","haze"]`, the blade skin's
options its wearer switched off ([Options](#options)): optional in a request (at most 8
distinct ids of 1 to 24 of `a`-`z`, `0`-`9`, `_`, else 400 `bad_look`; an older hub
refuses it with `bad_body`, so a client sends it only when it names one), stored with
the look and given back in presence and look events only when not empty.

`saber` is a blade-skin unlock id or `""` for the stock blade; `illuminate` is
whether the Illuminate holocron is lit. Both are required in a request.

- `POST /v1/look` (signed) `{"server":"ip:port","saber":"..","illuminate":false}`.
  Exactly those fields (400 `bad_body` otherwise). `server` as in claims (400
  `bad_server`). The key must hold a live claim on `server` (403 `not_on_server`);
  the hub takes the slot and claimed name from it. A `saber` that is not `""` must be
  a blade skin in the catalogue (400 `bad_look`) that the key holds (403
  `not_unlocked`). At most one look a second per key and 30 a minute (429
  `look_quota`; a refused one does not count). Looks share the chat and emotes
  per-address allowance. Answers `{"id":<n>}`, the feed id of its event.
- The look is kept on the claim. Renewing the claim for the same server, slot and
  name keeps it; a claim for another server, slot or name, a release or the claim's
  expiry drops it (a new claim starts with no look).
- Presence entries gain `"look":{"saber":"..","illuminate":false}` when the claim
  has one (absent otherwise).
- The feed gains `looks`, sharing the id sequence: the look events on the reader's
  `server` with an id above `after`, oldest first, kept for 60 seconds. Each:

      {"id":15,"at":<unix s>,"slot":3,"claimed_name":"^2Sol","key_id":"..",
       "saber":"saber_sun","illuminate":true}

  A batch with looks is not empty. `after` 0 or above the newest id (a new
  reader, or a hub that restarted) gives the server's looks of the last 60 seconds:
  looks are state, so a reader's first answer must not miss one, and applied oldest
  first they leave each slot with its latest look.
- A client applies a look, as emotes and badges, only when the name its game shows in
  `slot` matches `claimed_name`.

## Client

### Settings and commands

Built.

- `cg_saberSkin` (archived, default empty; one registration, the constant
  `unlockables::SABER_SKIN_CVAR`): the blade-skin unlock id the player wears. It
  applies only while the player's own hub profile lists that unlock; with no
  identity, no hub, the hub not answered yet or the unlock missing, the stock blade
  shows and nothing is sent. The looks read it twice a second and gate it
  (`Looks::own_saber_skin`); the renderer takes the gated skin from there
  (`GpuState::local_saber_skin`, [saber_skins.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/saber_skins.rs)),
  for the hand, first person, a thrown saber, the sounds and the Character page's
  preview.
- `saberskin` ([saber_skin_command.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/saber_skin_command.rs))
  alone lists the blade skins: id, name, owned (since when) or locked (how to get
  it), which one is worn or chosen, and why ownership is not known when it is not
  (identity off, no hub, waiting). `saberskin <id>` (case ignored, stored as the
  catalogue's id) or `saberskin none` sets `cg_saberSkin`; a locked skin is set all
  the same and the answer says it shows only once unlocked. An unknown id is refused.
  Tab completes the command's name; its argument has no completion (the console
  completes command and cvar names only).
- `unlockables` opens (or closes) the Collection on its Shaders tab: in the SJK UI
  the Collection screen ([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#collection)).

Verified by unit tests (the listing, the answers, the cvar set even when locked, the
gate); not yet used against the deployed hub.

### Sending

Built ([service.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/service.rs),
[looks_frame.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/looks_frame.rs)). Twice a second the viewer
computes the own look: `cg_saberSkin` when the client knows that blade skin and the own
profile lists it (else `""`), and whether the local Illuminate is lit; it hands it to
`Service::set_look` only when it changed. The identity worker keeps the latest. After
its claim on a server is accepted, and whenever the look changes, it sends
`POST /v1/look`, at most one a second (changes in between are coalesced, the latest
wins); a new claim (another server, slot or name) sends it again, and renewing the
same claim does not. What the hub holds is known (none for a new claim or after a
release, else the last look it took) or unknown: at the worker's start (a client that
stopped without releasing may have left a live claim with a look), after a failed claim
(it may have lapsed, or still be live with the old look) and after a failed release.
A look equal to none (stock blade, holocron out) is not sent on a claim known to hold
none; while unknown, the next accepted claim gets the look whatever it is. A
`not_unlocked` (or `bad_look`) answer leaves that skin out, the look going on with
`saber:""` so Illuminate still syncs, until the profile's unlocks change. The own
profile is read every ten minutes, and sooner (at most once every 30 seconds) after a
`not_unlocked`, or when the feed relays a look of the player's own key, newer than the
last one sent, with another blade skin (staff took it back; `Service::take_looks`
hands it to the worker), so a relocked skin leaves the player's own blade within
seconds; too many
(429: `look_quota`, or the per-address `rate_limited` the chat and emotes share), a
refused signature (401) and failures wait 10 seconds and go again; `not_on_server`
waits for the next accepted claim;
another refusal (an older hub) is not repeated until the look or the claim changes.
Leaving the server sends nothing (the release drops the look).
`Snapshot::look_outcome` holds what became of the last one. Unit tests against a fake
hub, and end to end (`hub_e2e`) against the hub's unlocks work in progress run on this
PC: a look needs a claim, shows in presence and the feed, survives the claim's renewal
but not another slot, a skin the key lacks is refused until granted, and the service
wears its look (without a skin it lacks) and reads looks with the chat off.

### Receiving

Built ([feed.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/feed.rs),
[looks.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/looks.rs)). The feed reads on a game server
whatever `cl_sjkChat` says, keeping no message with the chat off, and queues the
looks it gets (`Service::take_looks`, the newest 64). Another game server is read
from `after` 0, so its first answer brings that server's looks of the last minute.
Each queued look keeps the server it was read for and the reading's generation, which
changes with the hub, the server or the identity going off or on; the viewer is
handed only the looks read for the server it is on under the current generation, and
clears every hub look (reading the roster again) when the generation changes, so a
poll still under way at a change cannot bring an old look back. `GpuState::looks` keeps one look
per slot (64): the presence roster's when its revision changes (it replaces every hub
look) and feed events as they come (newer, so they win until the roster changes
again). A look counts only while the game shows the claimed name in its slot (the
badges' rule); the names are compared when a roster or an event comes and twice a
second, so a frame only reads a fixed table. Another server, leaving or a new feed
generation clears them.
An unknown skin id draws the stock blade. A player muted on this PC
([hub-chat.md](hub-chat.md#muting-a-player)) wears nothing while muted: the stock
blade without the skin's sounds, no holocron (`Looks::set_muted`, which never mutes
the own slot). The local player's own look comes from its
settings, not the hub.

What the renderer reads, on `GpuState::looks`:

- `saber_skin_id(client) -> Option<&'static str>`: the blade skin the player in that
  slot wears (a catalogue id), `None` for the stock blade; the local player's slot
  holds its own gated skin.
- `revision()`: changes whenever what a slot wears (or the own look) changes, so the
  blade skins' table is filled again only then.
- `illuminated(client) -> bool`: their holocron is lit.
- `own_saber_skin() -> Option<&'static str>`: the local player's gated skin, in a game
  or not (first person, the Character page's preview).

The player card ([client.md](client.md#player-card)) names the shader a player wears,
with its live swatch, by the same rule: the looks' skin for another slot, the own gated
skin for the local player's, and only when its pack is loaded, so the card never names
a shader their blade does not show here (10/10/2026).

### Blade skins

Built (renderer and sounds); who wears which is the viewer's per-client table, filled
from the looks.

- A blade skin's look is its blade-skin file, loaded from the packs
  ([saber_skins.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/saber_skins.rs) `LoadedSkins`, at most
  16): drawn as its own saber material after the neutral RGB pair, with its glow/core
  pair (the pack's images or generated from the file's profiles), coloured and animated
  in `saber.wgsl` from per-instance time, a per-blade seed and the file's parameters
  (core, corona gradient, granulation, flame tongues, shimmer, flares and, when the
  file has them, lightning arcs, drifting motes and a turning hue); the dynamic glow
  pass gets the same animation ([rendering.md](rendering.md#saber-blade-skins)). Its
  trail and light colours and the light's flicker (and hue, when it turns) are the
  file's. Retail and RGB blades are unchanged. A skin whose pack is not loaded (no hub
  yet, a client offline that never had it) is the stock blade, sounds too.
- A skinned blade ends round (09/10/2026; Sol saw the Sun's tip square). The core line
  is a flat quad from behind the hilt to the tip, and the generated core's fringe is
  still about a fifth of its brightness at the quad's edges and end, so its end and
  corners showed as a bright square, plainest with a wide, bright fringe like the Sun's
  over a tip glow half as bright as the shaft's (stock blades draw the same flat line,
  but their white core is hidden in their glow). Past the tip, too, the corona's
  grading and its flame tongues were taken from the distance across only, so they ran
  on straight beyond the tip as a column, and a widening corona widened only sideways.
  Now, for skins only: over its last `core.tip` half-widths the core line narrows on a
  quarter circle to a rounded point and is cut (softly, over a pixel) at that edge;
  past the tip the corona widens about the tip as about the shaft, its distance out is
  measured from the tip, and the tongues run on round it. Along the shaft nothing
  changed. Pinned by a test of a CPU copy of the tip's maths (the shaft unchanged, the
  quarter circle, the corners cut, the glow round past the tip) that also checks the
  shader holds the same expressions.
- Shown for every client whose entry in the viewer's `SaberSkins` table is set: in the
  game, in first person, thrown, and on the menu stage (the Character page) for the
  local player. Once a frame (`GpuState::sync_saber_skins`) the table takes every
  other slot's skin from `Looks::saber_skin_id` when the looks' revision or the loaded
  skins changed (no allocation; 32 lookups only then), and the local player's own from
  the gated `Looks::own_saber_skin` in its slot (also with no session, for the
  preview). That slot is the game state's `client_num`, not the snapshot's player
  state's: following (spectating) someone, the state is theirs (`PMF_FOLLOW`), and they
  keep their own hub look, blades, thrown saber and sounds alike (`looks::ViewSlots`).
- Sounds, per player wearing it: ignition and switching off, the hum loop and three
  swings play over the stock ones, which keep playing below (each on a channel of its
  own, so the skin's does not cut them), at the paths the file names in its pack. The viewer
  passes the table to the audio adapter every frame
  (`LegacySoundAdapter::set_saber_sound_overrides`, [client.md](client.md#blade-skins)),
  so other players' sounds follow their looks too; a pack arriving mid-session has its
  sounds registered at once. A thrown saber hums the skin's hum as well: over the saber
  entity's own `loopSound`, while its owner (`genericenemyindex`) wears a skin.
- Verified: unit tests against a made-up test skin (material slots, the uniform's
  layout and values, colours and flicker, the table following the looks, the gated own
  skin and the loaded skins, loading from a pack with images and sounds, a runtime
  mount, the sound overrides per client and registered mid-session, a thrown saber's
  hum), `saber.wgsl` validated by naga, and the `duel6_sun_blade` world shot with the
  hub's pack built locally (`SJK_TEST_PACKS`), compared with shots of the earlier
  built-in Sun. Not verified: the sounds by ear, a live match, another player's skin
  from a real hub, a pack downloaded from the deployed hub.

### Tiers

Built 10/10/2026 (Sol's request: give shaders qualities, as more come, plainer ones
too). Every blade skin has a tier (`Unlockable::tier`, `unlockables::Rarity` in
[unlockables.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/unlockables.rs)), one of the holocrons' four,
with the holocron tier's name (`Tier::label`) and colour
([holocrons.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/holocrons.rs)) so a Rare shader and a Rare
holocron look alike:

| Tier | Shaders |
| --- | --- |
| Mythical | Sun, Void, Molten, Spectral |
| Legendary | Storm, Unstable, Chameleon, Prism (provisional) |
| Rare | Frost, Hologram, Runic, Heartbeat, Glitch (provisional), Banner (provisional) |
| Uncommon | none yet: the plainer, colour-only shaders to come |

Sol placed eleven; Prism, Glitch and Banner are placed provisionally until Sol says
otherwise. The tier is the client catalogue's only: the hub does not need it yet (it
will when holocrons drop shaders, [Planned](#planned-not-built)).

- Lists: the Collection's Shaders tab and the Saber tab's Blade row list the rarest
  first, then in catalogue order within a tier (`unlockables::blade_skins_by_tier`),
  the stock blade first. Profiles, the hub and the Staff page keep the catalogue's
  order.
- Shown: the Collection's rack frames each swatch in its tier's colour (quieter when
  locked) and names the tier at the right of its state line; its cards carry a band of
  the tier's colour along the top, a frame and the tier's name; beside the model a pill
  in the tier's colour stands over the kind line; the Saber tab's swatches have a thin
  edge in it; the player card frames the worn shader's swatch in it and writes its name
  in the colour lifted toward white.
- Animated: every tier from Rare up has its rarity effects there
  ([Rarity effects](#rarity-effects)).

### Rarity effects

Built 10/10/2026 (Sol's request: small light animated touches that show off how rare a
thing is, for shaders, holocrons and what comes later).
[rarity_fx.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/rarity_fx.rs) draws them for any tier, with the
UI's own shapes into the frame's draw list (no texture, no pipeline of its own), at most
30 commands an item, every one inside the item's frame, the same picture at the same
moment (no state, no randomness). Each tier up adds to the one under it:

| Tier | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommon | none |
| Rare | the frame's glow breathes: a soft pulse every 3 seconds |
| Legendary | the breath, and a slanted sheen sweeping left to right (1.4 seconds of every 4, each frame at its own moment so a page does not flash at once) |
| Mythical | the sheen, a bright spark running round the border with a short tail (a lap in 3.2 seconds), and on cards and tiles four faint motes rising inside |

- Sizes: `Full` (the Collection's cards, the Holocrons tab's tier rows) has all of it;
  `Small` (the rack's swatch frames, the detail's tier pill, the Saber tab's swatches)
  leaves out the motes and has a shorter sheen; `Tiny` (the player card's shader row)
  only breathes, quietly.
- Locked: a shader not held (or a holocron tier not held) only breathes, at about a
  third of the strength, so what the player holds stands out.
- `ui_rarityEffects` (archived, default 1; Settings > Interface > Rarity effects) turns
  them off: the tier frames stay, still.
- The chosen card of the grid is marked apart from any tier: it lifts 5 pixels over a
  shadow and a white outline goes round it (until 10/10/2026 a gold border, which read
  like Mythical's gold frame).
- Not used: the holocron pop-up, which has its own ceremony in the tier's colour (rings,
  light, ticks), and the SJK chat's gem marks, too small at text size for a frame to
  show.
- Verified: unit tests (every shader's tier, the order, the holocrons' names and
  colours) and the world shots of the Collection (`duel6_sjk_collection`); not tried
  in the game.

### Chromas

Built 10/10/2026 (Sol's request: mark the shaders that can be coloured). A **chroma**
is a blade skin that takes its wearer's saber colour: `color1` for the first saber,
`color2` for the second, a retail colour or a custom RGB, as the stock blade would be
drawn. The flag is the client catalogue's (`Unlockable::chroma` in
[unlockables.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/unlockables.rs)); the hub and the packs are
unchanged. Chromas: Storm, Unstable, Spectral, Glitch, Hologram, Runic and Heartbeat
(my proposal to Sol). Sun, Frost, Void and Molten keep their themed colours; Prism,
Chameleon and Banner are about their colour.

- **How it is drawn** ([saber_skins.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/saber_skins.rs)
  `Chroma`, `SkinColor::worn_with`): the skin's own hue is its corona rim's
  (`hue_of`: the angle round the grey axis from red, in the sense `turn_hue` turns;
  the light's colour if the rim is grey). Worn on a saber, every colour the skin draws
  (glow, core, arcs, motes, veins, scan lines, glyphs, embers) is turned round the grey
  axis by the gap from that hue to the saber colour's, keeping brightness and
  saturation; the dynamic light and the blur trail turn with it. A grey or white
  colour (under 20 % saturation) has no hue to take: the skin is drawn as its file
  says. The turn rides on every blade instance (`Instance::chroma`, attribute 8), so
  `saber.wgsl` turns the finished glow and core once; other players' blades take their
  colours from their `CS_PLAYERS` string, so everyone sees a chroma in its wearer's
  colour. A pale skin (the Storm, the Hologram) stays pale, only tinted.
- **The mark**: a small colour wheel (twelve hue segments round a white dot,
  `swatch::chroma_mark`) beside a chroma's name on the Collection's rack and before
  "Chroma saber shader: takes your saber colour" beside the model, in the corner of its
  swatch on the Saber tab's Blade row, and between its swatch and name on the player
  card. The swatches draw a chroma in the player's own colour (the card: in the
  player's first saber colour when it is a retail one).
- Verified: unit tests (hues and turns, grey and white kept, every retail colour and a
  custom one, each saber of a pair its own turn, the instance carrying it, the chroma
  list pinned, the mark inside its square, a turned swatch, the card with the wheel
  inside the screen at five sizes) and the world shot `duel6_chroma_blades` (every
  chroma in the six retail colours and white) with the hub's pack; not tried in the
  game.

### Packs

Built ([sjk_packs.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/sjk_packs.rs); the download is the
identity service's, [identity.md](identity.md#asset-packs)). A pack is a PK3 of game
paths the hub serves (`GET /v1/assets`, `GET /v1/assets/<name>`); today one,
`sjk_skins`, with the Sun blade's file and sounds.

- The identity service keeps them in `assets/<name>.pk3` beside `identity.key`,
  checked against the hub's size and SHA-256 and written in one rename.
- At start the viewer mounts every cached pack (`sjk_packs::mount_at_start`), whatever
  `cl_identity` says: the content is SJK's own and already on the machine. Its
  blade-skin files load into `LoadedSkins` under a new generation; each frame
  `GpuState` compares one atomic counter and, when it changed, uploads the skins'
  parameters and pairs and registers their sounds.
- Twice a second the viewer compares the service's count of packs written; when it
  changes the folder is mounted again, so a pack that arrives mid-session shows (and
  sounds) at once, for the local player and everyone wearing it. What the last check
  did is written to the log.
- Every game file system built for a world mounts the cached packs below all game data,
  as the holocron's files are.

### Blade-skin files

`skins/blades/<unlock id>.bladeskin` in a pack, a JSON object
([blade_skin_file.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/blade_skin_file.rs)). Parsing is strict:
an unknown or missing field, a wrong type or a value outside its range refuses the file,
and the log names the file and the field. A file whose id is not a blade skin of the
client's catalogue is left out (a newer pack may hold skins an older client does not
know). `grain` below is the granulation in [0, 1], `flare` the flares' sum at a point.
`arcs`, `motes` and `hue` are optional sections (09/10/2026), and so are `sputter`,
`glitch`, `scan`, `pulse`, `ghosts`, `embers`, `veins`, `team`, `ambient` and `glyphs`
(10/10/2026, [blade_skin_effects.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/blade_skin_effects.rs)): a
file without one draws none of it (its lanes of the uniform are zeros), so files written
before them draw as they did; when present, every field of the section is required.
`team` and `ambient` may not both be given.

The third set (11/10/2026, [blade_skin_extras.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/blade_skin_extras.rs)):
`star`, `wisps`, `haze`, `echo` and `options`. A client refuses a whole file holding a
field it does not know, so these live in an **additions file** beside the skin's,
`skins/blades/<id>.bladeextra`, a JSON object whose fields are laid over the skin file's
before it is read (a field in both is the addition's). A client from before never opens
it and draws the skin file alone, so a pack can grow without blanking a skin for older
clients; an additions file without its skin file is no skin. The same rules hold: each
section optional, every field of it required.

Other coefficients are any number from -1000 to 1000.

### Options

Built 11/10/2026 (Sol's request: some Mythical shaders get parts their wearer can
switch off; first the Sun and the Spectral). A skin's file names its parts (`options`,
[Blade-skin files](#blade-skin-files)); every part is on until its wearer switches it
off, and every other SJK player then draws the blade the same way.

| Skin | Parts (id: what it switches) |
| --- | --- |
| Sun | `prominences` Prominences (arcs), `sparks` Rising sparks (motes), `glint` Tip glint (star), `haze` Heat haze (haze) |
| Spectral | `wisps` Wisps (wisps), `spirits` Souls (motes), `smoke` Smoky edge (sputter), `rim` Cold rim (hue), `echo` Echo (echo), `afterimages` Afterimages (ghosts) |

- Kept in `cg_saberSkinOptions` (archived, default empty;
  [saber_skin_options.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/saber_skin_options.rs)): one
  `<skin>.<option>` word for each part switched off, sorted, so every skin keeps its
  choice while another is worn (`saber_sun.haze saber_spectral.wisps`).
- Chosen on the Collection's Shaders tab ([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#collection)): under an
  owned skin's words, "Parts" and a tick for each, in two columns (three past four);
  a click or the number keys 1 to 6 switch one, on the model at once. In the console,
  `saberskin <id> parts` lists them with their state and `saberskin <id> <part> on|off`
  switches one, so every menu style has it.
- Sent with the look: the worn skin's parts switched off go as `saber_off` (at most 8
  ids, sorted), only when there are some (a hub from before refuses the field), and come
  back in presence and feed looks. In a frame a choice is 64 bits, an option id's bit
  its FNV-1a hash modulo 64 (`blade_skin_extras::option_bit`, distinct within a skin by
  the file check), so the looks stay `Copy` and nothing is allocated; a viewer whose
  pack lacks an option ignores it.
- Drawn: the wearer's choice and the skin's options give a mask of sections switched off
  (`SkinColor::off`, `BladeSkinDef::off_mask`), carried by each instance (attribute 9);
  `saber.wgsl` zeroes those sections' lanes as a file without them has
  ([rendering.md](rendering.md#saber-blade-skins)), and the CPU leaves out the parts it
  makes itself: afterimages, the echo, the glint, the light's beat and hue turning, and
  the quad's room for wisps and haze.

Verified by unit tests (the cvar's words, the look carrying the worn skin's choice and
reading it back, a muted slot showing none, the option mask and room, the CPU's parts
left out, the instances' mask, the command, the file checks) and the world shots
`duel6_mythical_parts` (each skin with every part on beside every part off, close up
and upright, and the haze checked to bend the scene behind the Sun: about 87,000 pixels
change with it on, none of the glow's) and `duel6_sjk_collection` (the Parts grid of
the Sun and of the Spectral, one part off); not yet against the deployed hub or in a
live match.

### Illuminate for others

Built ([illuminate.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/illuminate.rs)). Every lit look puts a
holocron by that player's left shoulder, placed from their entity's interpolated
origin, eye height (from its box, so crouching lowers it) and view yaw, with the same
fade, bob, spin and trailing as one's own: the local holocron and one per other slot
step through the same code, each slot's bob a little out of step. The cube always
shows for another player while the game draws them; dead, hidden, cloaked or out of
the snapshot, it goes out where it was. Every cube shows, but only the four nearest
the camera add their warm light, so the frame's 32 lights stay for the weapons.
Following (spectating) another player, one's own holocron goes out and the followed
player's, if their look has it lit, floats by the view's eye as one's own does (their
entity is not in the snapshot), showing only its light in first person.
Unit tests and an off-screen shot on duel6 (two holocrons placed for remote players
without a session); not yet seen with real players, nor in follow mode.

### Shaders tab

Players read blade skins as saber **shaders** (10/10/2026, Sol's name, so body
shaders can follow): the player-facing words say "saber shader", the code and the hub
keep "blade skin" and the ids.

Built 08/10/2026 as the Unlockables page, the Profile screen's Collection tab in the
SJK UI; since 10/10/2026 the [Collection](sjk-ui.md#collection)'s Shaders tab
([collection_shaders.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/collection_shaders.rs), its swatches
in [collection_swatch.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/collection_swatch.rs)). An SJK page
in the SJK UI's look in every menu style; in the SJK UI the main page's and the
in-game menu's Collection open it, with the classic menus `unlockables` (and the
Profile page's See the collection) open it on its own:

- a rack, a row to each, or a grid of cards (below): the stock blade (in the player's
  `color1`), then every blade skin, the rarest [tier](#tiers) first, with a live swatch
  framed in its tier's colour (drawn with the UI's shapes from its loaded file's
  colours, flicker and flares, moving: a breathing corona, flame loops and granules, a
  flare running hilt to tip, and the file's lightning arcs, motes and turning hue when
  it has them; grey and still under a padlock when locked; owned but with its pack not
  loaded yet, a neutral still blade; a chroma in the player's colour, with its colour
  wheel before its name), its name and its state (Worn, Yours, Locked) under it, its
  tier's name at the right of that line in its colour; a click chooses a row, a double click (within 0.4 s) wears an owned one as Equip does
  (a locked one stays a preview, the worn one stays on);
- the grid (10/10/2026, Sol's request, so many shaders scroll quickly): cards of
  164 by 196 frame pixels, five to a line, three lines shown, each with a band of its
  tier's colour along the top, a frame in it (gold and thicker for the chosen one), the
  live swatch, the chroma's wheel, the name without "blade", the tier's name and the
  state. The arrows move in two directions (Left and Right a card, Up and Down a line,
  stopping at the ends), the wheel scrolls a line a notch keeping the chosen card in
  view, a click chooses, a double click wears an owned one as on the rack, and a thin
  bar at the right shows where it is once there are more lines than three. Two
  switches left of the kinds (three bars: the rack; four squares: the grid) and V
  change the view; `ui_shaderView` (archived, 0 the rack, 1 the grid) keeps it;
- the player's model holding the chosen blade, on the menu map's stage or in the
  page's live preview over a match: a locked one too, as a preview this screen alone
  draws (`PreviewSkin`; nothing is set or sent);
- beside the model what the chosen one is: its tier as a pill in the tier's colour,
  its kind, its name and, at the column's
  right end, its state pill (10/10/2026: the name ends short of the pill, ellipsised,
  instead of the pill following a measured name, which overlapped it when the drawn
  face was wider than the measure), owned (`Yours since dd/mm/yyyy, from the
  SJK team` and the team's note, or `..., with your Bug Hunter medal` when a medal
  brings it) or how to get it, and Equip, Unequip or Wear the
  stock blade, which set `cg_saberSkin`;
- with the identity off, no hub or no answer yet, the tab says so and no skin is
  owned.

The Staff page lists every unlockable for the player found, with Unlock (sending the
note field's text) and Relock ([identity.md](identity.md#staff)), two to a row of 36
pixels (10/10/2026) so the whole catalogue (fourteen) fits above the keys, each with the
one button that applies.

Verified: unit tests (keys, pointer, the worn one chosen on opening, equip and unequip,
a locked one previewed but never equipped, every row and its words within the canvas
at 1080p, 4K, 4:3 and 21:9, the swatch moving and staying inside its frame, the Staff
page's Unlock and Relock; the grid's switches and V, its arrows in two directions, its
wheel, a double click on a card, every card above the keys at the four shapes) and the
world shot `duel6_sjk_collection` (the Sun worn on the stage, the Storm previewed, the
grid with five owned, a 4:3 window and its grid, the in-game preview, the classic
menus) with the hub's pack; not tried in the game.

### Saber tab's blade choice

Built 10/10/2026 (Sol's request: choose an unlocked blade skin where the saber is
made), [player_menu/blade_skins.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/player_menu/blade_skins.rs),
drawn by the Saber page ([sjk-ui.md](sjk-ui.md#character)). In the SJK UI the
Profile screen's Saber tab has a Blade row: the stock blade in the first blade's
colour, then every blade skin the player's own hub profile lists, in catalogue
order, each drawn as its Collection swatch shrunk (`swatch::small_blade`, the same
drawing scaled; the stock one `swatch::small_stock`). Locked skins are not listed
there, the Collection shows them; with the identity off, no hub, the hub not
answered yet or no skin owned, only the stock blade shows, with a line saying why.
What the player owns is read twice a second while the tab shows (and when the screen
opens), without copying the identity's state (`player_identity::with_snapshot`).

Picking a blade (a click, or Left and Right on the row) sets `cg_saberSkin` through
`unlockables::wear`, which the Collection's Equip and Unequip use too, by the same
rules (`Holdings::can_wear`, `Holdings::worn_blade_skin`, which the profile card
also reads); the stock blade sets it empty. A click on the blade already shown
chosen writes nothing, so a skin chosen before the hub answered stays chosen. The
stage model (or the live preview, opened from a game) wears the skin once the looks
read the setting again, within half a second, as after Equip. The classic menus are
unchanged.

Verified: unit tests (the stock blade and the owned skins offered in catalogue order,
locked and unknown ids left out, picking and stepping writing the setting, a pending
choice kept, the hint without skins or identity, a click on a swatch wearing it, the
page with every skin carrying every effect within the screen's canvas, Dual too) and
the world shot `duel6_sjk_saber_page` with the hub's pack (`SJK_TEST_PACKS`); not
tried in the game.

## Medal shaders

Built 10/10/2026, branch `personal/medal-blades` (with the hub's `feat/medal-blades`),
Sol's decision: Bug Hunter brings the Glitch blade, Early Tester the Hologram, Early
Contributor the Runic. The hub derives the unlock from the medal when it reads a profile
or a look (no grant row), lists it in the profile's `unlocks` with `medal` set to the
medal's id while no grant by hand covers it, and takes it back with the medal's last
award, clearing it off a live look with a look event. A grant by hand of the same blade
is separate and outlives the medal. The client ([wire.rs](../crates/sjk-identity/src/wire.rs)
`Unlock::medal`, absent from older hubs) wears it like any unlock (`Holdings::can_wear`
is unchanged); the Collection's Shaders tab says "Yours since dd/mm/yyyy, with your Bug
Hunter medal", its Medals tab adds "Comes with the Glitch blade, a saber shader." under
what the medal is for, and the three blades' "How to get it" names the medal
(`Medal::blade` in [medals.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/medals.rs) pins the pairs, a
test checks the texts). Verified: unit tests (client and hub, the hub's covering award,
counted awards, revoke, a grant by hand surviving, relock and the look); the hub not
deployed when built, nothing tried in the game.

## Planned, not built

Achievements granting unlockables (with harder goals), holocrons dropping blade skins
(parked: pool, odds and duplicates undecided; the shaders' [tiers](#tiers) would then
be the hub's too, to roll a shader of a holocron's tier), Uncommon shaders (colours
only), other kinds of unlockable (holocron
skins, trails, emotes). Up to 16 blade skins load at once (the renderer's slots; the
uniform array is 15104 bytes of the 16 KiB WebGPU guarantees since the third set, so
a seventeenth skin, or four more lanes a skin, needs fewer lanes or a storage buffer
first).
