# Architecture

SJK implements the client and server as native Rust programs. The current game
is Jedi Academy multiplayer; engine services use owned worlds and explicit
interfaces rather than a process-wide legacy "current map". SJK implements game
rules itself rather than hosting the original game DLLs.

## Boundaries

1. Authoritative simulation and client presentation have different owners and
   lifetimes. A rendered world can remain resident during a network transition.
2. Protocol 26 is an adapter. Wire client/entity numbers, configstrings and
   fixed packet limits must not become universal engine identities or capacities.
3. JKA rules and format constraints belong in compatibility crates. The generic
   server owns worlds and entity handles; the dedicated bridge supplies gameplay
   and maps those handles to the legacy endpoint.
4. Content paths are normalized, case-insensitive virtual paths. Asset ownership
   is explicit; loading another map must not silently replace global asset state.
   A read ignores one leading `/` or `\`, as `FS_FOpenFileRead` does; mounted
   names, archive entries and writes still refuse it.
5. Platform code and GPU resources stay at application/integration boundaries.
   UI layout and audio mixing have independent engine interfaces.
6. Downloaded content is handled through bounded storage operations. Remote paths
   must not become unrestricted local filesystem paths.

These are maintenance constraints. Existing compatibility dependencies do not
justify spreading JKA-specific constants into unrelated engine services.

## Resident client worlds

The viewer separates its displayed world from a connection waiting for a map.
`session_transition::resident::State` parks that transport outside `live_session`,
so snapshot consumers cannot render new-map entities against the retained BSP.
During a live map change the old world is only a backdrop beneath a loading
notice: it has no local gameplay authority. Intermission remains owned by the
remote session, including its normal camera, scores, chat and ready controls.
The viewer does not depend on the dedicated-server crate or construct a native
game while loading maps. Early entry into a joined world before a server player
exists still uses the movement-only predictor.

The waiting transport sends neutral commands on a separate timer and continues
receiving lifecycle events and messages. A matching prepared map can be reused
on a same-map restart; attachment resets presentation and anchors prediction to
the remote snapshot. Wire codecs remain unchanged.

CPU preparation and GPU installation own immutable destination inputs. Superseding
transitions discard their channels; GPU construction checks cancellation between
build stages. Only a completed world is adopted. A prepared gamestate's content
selection must match before attaching a session without rebuilding, and a restart
must receive a fresh snapshot before attachment. A join from the menu hands over
the destination world prepared while it connected
([portal.rs](../crates/sjk-viewer/src/portal.rs)) rather than constructing a
duplicate at entry. The parked
menu world remains separately owned for cancellation/disconnection.

PK3 checksum inventory uses the validated ZIP central directory, retaining archive
entry order, CRCs and zero-length filtering. It does not visit/decompress every
payload during connection; normal asset reads remain responsible for payload and
local-header validation. See [pk3_fingerprint.rs](../crates/sjk-vfs/src/pk3_fingerprint.rs).

## Main flows

Client: network session → decoded snapshots → client/game compatibility →
owned presentation state → viewer rendering, UI and audio. Local prediction uses
shared movement rules; it does not replace server authority.

Server: UDP → legacy endpoint →
[game bridge](../crates/sjk-dedicated/src/bridge.rs) → game simulation and native
world storage → per-client legacy replication.

Assets: VFS → compatibility parsers → owned map/model/shader data → scene and
application resources. BSP geometry remains the collision input for JKA maps.
